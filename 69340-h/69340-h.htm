<div><h1>SARD HARKER</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PART ONE</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>anta Barbara</span> lies far to leeward, with a coast
facing to the north and east. It is the richest of the
sugar countries. Plantations cover all the lowland
along its seven hundred miles of seaboard, then above the
lowland is foothill, covered with forest, rising to the Sierras
of the Three Kings, which make the country’s frontier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The city of Santa Barbara lies at the angle of the coast in
the bight of a bay. The Old Town covers the southern,
the New Town the northern horn of the bay: in between
are the docks and quays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the northern or New Town there is a plaza or square,
called Of the Martyrdoms. Until about thirty years ago,
there was a block of dwelling-houses on the western side of
this square, which attracted the notice of visitors. Though
the other buildings in the square were gay or smart, with
flowers, colours and lights, these were always dingy, by
decree. If any asked why they were dingy, they were told
that those were the houses of the last sighs, “las casas de los
sospiros ultimos,” and that they dated from the time of the
Troubles under Don Lopez, who was Dictator de Santa
Barbara from 1875 till 1887.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Don Lopez de Meruel, called The Terrible, after
nine years of murder and cruelty, began a year of madness
by decreeing that he should be given divine honours in all
the churches of the State. Finding himself opposed by
some of the clergy and by many of the hidalgos, he seized
the daughter of one of his richest landowners, Señorita
Carlotta de Leyva de San Jacinto, then on a visit to the
capital, and ordered her to pray to him while he sat throned
in public on the high altar of the mission church. On her
refusal, he ordered her to be enclosed in a house of common
prostitutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mistress of this house, an Englishwoman known as
Aunt Jennings, refused to obey the order to receive her.
“Miss Carlotta is a lady,” she said, “and she does not come
in here. And none but a dirty dog would have thought
of sending her. And as for praying to the dirty dog, Miss
Carlotta has done quite right. If he wants folk to pray
to him, let him come here, and my little Sunday school will
give him all the pray he wants with a wet rag off the
dresser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this was reported to Don Lopez, he ordered that
Carlotta and Aunt Jennings should be taken along the
water-front by the hangman as far as the Plaza in the New
Town, and that there their throats should be publicly cut
against the walls of the houses on the west side, then used
as houses of charity. This deed was at once done. The
two women were killed by Don Lopez’ son, Don José, then
a lad of twenty, assisted by a negro (Jorge) and two half-breeds
(Zarzas and Don Livio).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Manuel San Substantio Encinitas, the betrothed
lover of Carlotta, was then at his estate of Las Mancinillas,
two hundred miles away. When the news of the crime
was brought to him, he gathered his friends, sympathisers,
and estate servants, some seven hundred in all, and marched
to unseat Don Lopez and avenge the murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His army was routed by Don Lopez in a green savannah
near the city; many of his friends, not killed in the fighting,
were hunted down and killed; he himself, with about
forty horsemen, rode from the battlefield, then swerved
and made a dash for the city. They appeared at the Old
Town at sunset and summoned the fortress to surrender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Livio, who commanded in the fortress, recognised
Don Manuel and determined to outwit him. While parleying
at the gate as though for terms, he sent a lad, one
Pablo de Chaco-Chaco, to some Republican troops quartered
outside the fortress in a sugar warehouse. These troops,
being warned by Pablo, took up their positions in windows
commanding Don Manuel’s troop and suddenly fired in
among them. In the skirmish which followed, Don Manuel’s
men fell back along the water-front, and were shot
down as they went. As darkness closed in, the last six
of them, including Don Manuel, gathered at what is known
in the ballads as the Bajel Verde, a green boat or lighter
drawn up on the beach. Here they made a stand till
their ammunition failed. They then took to the water,
swimming, in the hope of reaching some English ship in
the harbour. But by this time Don Livio had sent out
soldiers in boats to patrol the water-front. All of the six
except Don Manuel, were shot or clubbed, as they swam,
by these patrols. Don Manuel, through fortune, and because
he took to the water some minutes after the others, managed
to reach the English barque <span class='it'>Venturer</span>, whose captain (Cary)
took him aboard, and brought him a few days later to
safety in Port Matoche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eighteen months later, having laid his plans with care,
Don Manuel sailed from Calinche with another company,
in a tramp steamer. He landed unexpectedly at Santa
Barbara, shot Don Lopez with his own hand and made
himself Dictator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of frequent risings of the Lopez faction, most
of them led or inspired by Don José, who had escaped
Don Manuel’s justice, the rule of the New Dictator was the
most fruitful of modern times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lopez had caused a rhyme to be carven over the door
of the cathedral of Santa Barbara. In translation it
runs:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Lopez found me brick</p>
<p class='line0'>And left me stone.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>When the new cathedral was built upon the site of the
old, men remembered this rhyme, and pled that it should
be recarven:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Lopez found me brick and left me stone,</p>
<p class='line0'>Manuel made me like an angel’s throne.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>For indeed Don Manuel, in his rebuilding of the city,
made the cathedral the marvel of the New World. That and
the chapel of Carlotta at his palace, were the chief of his
works in his own mind; but in truth he made Santa Barbara
as eminent for the arts and sciences as for religion. He
founded, built and endowed four big universities, three
opera-houses, nineteen theatres. He discovered, encouraged,
helped, and at last employed through the years of
their power, all the architects, sculptors, painters, musicians
and poets who have made Santa Barbara the glory of
Spanish-speaking America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his person Don Manuel was as glorious as his mind.
He has been described in a sonnet:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>A calm like Jove’s beneath a fiery air.</p>
<p class='line0'>His hands most beautiful and full of force,</p>
<p class='line0'>Able to kill the wolf and tame the horse</p>
<p class='line0'>Or carve the granite into angels’ hair.</p>
<p class='line0'>His brow most noble over eyes that burn</p>
<p class='line0'>At thought of truth or knowledge wanting aid.</p>
<p class='line0'>His mind a very sword to make afraid,</p>
<p class='line0'>A very fire to beacon at the turn.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>His step swift as a panther’s, his will fierce</p>
<p class='line0'>To be about the beauty of some deed,</p>
<p class='line0'>Since beauty’s being is his spirit’s food.</p>
<p class='line0'>His voice caressing where it does not pierce;</p>
<p class='line0'>His wrath like lightning: he is King: indeed</p>
<p class='line0'>He is much more, a King with gratitude.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chisholm Harker, rector of Windlesham, in Berkshire,
wrote a pamphlet on English Mediæval Mystical Romances,
and died young, leaving a widow and one son, Chisholm,
the “Sard” Harker of these pages, who was thirteen at
his father’s death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Harker married again two years later. Sard, at his
own request, went to sea, sailing first in the barque <span class='it'>Venturer</span>,
Captain Cary, mentioned a page or two back. He
was on his first voyage in her when Don Manuel took refuge
in her. She was one of Messrs. Wrattson &amp; Willis’s sugar-clippers,
then regularly trading to the ports of Santa Barbara.
Later in his time Sard followed Captain Cary into
the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> and remained with him in her as third, second
and at last as chief mate. He was mate of the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>
and had been for ten years at sea when this tale begins.
He was called “Sard” Harker (though seldom to his face)
because he was judged to be sardonic. He, too, has been
described in a sonnet:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>A lean man, silent, behind triple bars</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of pride, fastidiousness and secret life.</p>
<p class='line0'>His thought an austere commune with the stars,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;His speech a probing with a surgeon’s knife.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>His style a chastity whose acid burns</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;All slack false formlessness in man or thing;</p>
<p class='line0'>His face a record of the truth man learns</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Fighting bare-knuckled Nature in the ring.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>His self (unseen until a danger breaks)</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Serves as a man, but when the peril comes</p>
<p class='line0'>And weak souls turn to water, his awakes</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Like bright salvation among martyrdoms.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Then, with the danger mastered, once again</p>
<p class='line0'>He goes behind his doors and draws the chain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Cary, who had made the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> a famous
ship, thought him the best officer he had ever had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> was the last and finest of Messrs.
Wrattson &amp; Willis’s sugar clippers. She made some
famous passages in the sugar and wool trades before she
went the way of her kind. She has been mentioned in
several sonnets:</p>

<p class='line0'>Gurgles of water run along her side,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;She does not heed them: they are not the sea.</p>
<p class='line0'>She is at peace from all her wandering now,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Quiet is in the very bones of her;</p>
<p class='line0'>The glad thrust of the leaning of her bow</p>

<p class='pindent'>Las Palomas, where this story begins, is far away to
windward on the sea-coast of the Tierra Firme. It has
grown to be an important city since the northern railway
was completed. It has been a frequented port since the
days of the Conquistadores, because it is a safe harbour
in all winds save the north, with good holding ground
and an abundance of pure water for the filling. In the
years 1879-80 it had an evil name, for it was then the
nearest seaport to the newly discovered goldfields at Entre
las Montanas in the province of Palo Seco, three hundred
miles inland. Many diggers returning with gold from the
fields were knocked on the head at Las Palomas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Las Palomas means the Doves. It got its name from
the blue rock-pigeons which used to haunt the cliffs just
south of the old (or Spanish) town. The cliffs are now
covered with buildings and the pigeons are gone. The
only doves thereabouts now are the Little Doves of Santa
Clara in a Convent school so named.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Las Palomas was formerly mainly a coffee and sugar
port, but of late years it has become a great place for the
exportation of copper-ore from the mines at Tloatlucan,
only seven miles inland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly thirty years ago, when this story begins, there
was open savannah to the north and north-west of Las
Palomas city. In those days you could walk (in that
direction) in less than an hour from the heart of the city into
primeval forest. If you walked due north along the beach,
from Jib and Foresail Quay on the water-front, you could
reach a part of the forest in two miles. This was a clump
of pines which came right down to the sea on a tongue of
red earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If, in those days, you walked through those pines, still
northward over the tongue, you came to a little beach,
edged with a low bank of shrubbery. There, between the
forest and the sea, was the mansion known as Los Xicales,
where old General Martinez, the last descendant of one who
came there with Cortés, lived to his end in faith, poverty
and style.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Los Xicales.</span>—Nobody knew at a first hearing what the
xicales were. They were not jicales nor jicaras, as many
thought, but trumpet-shaped flowers, with blue and white
stripes, which General Martinez had brought there from
the Indian territory. They were neither convolvuluses,
petunias, nor hermositas, though like all three. They
were just “xicales,” which is as near as the Spaniards
could come to the Indian name for them, which means,
simply, “flowers.” The house might have been called
“the flowers” without loss of time.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening of the 18th March, 1887, just ten years
before my story begins, Sard Harker, then on his first
voyage to sea, lay in the barque <span class='it'>Venturer</span>, in Las Palomas
harbour, expecting to sail at daybreak for Santa Barbara,
“to complete with sugar for home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the day, while bending sails aloft, he had seen the
white walls of Los Xicales and had been struck by their
likeness to a house in England, near the sea, where he
had stayed as a child. He had taken a good look at the
place, while waiting for the sail to come up to him, with the
thought that it was either a coastguard station or a lighthouse.
After that, work occupied him until dusk, so that
he put the house out of his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some weeks he had been training himself to be
“a hard case,” that is, able to stand exposure, by sleeping
on the top of the deckhouse, between the mizen staysail
and one of the boats. Here, with one blanket between
himself and the deck, one blanket over him, and a coil of
boat’s falls for a pillow, he went to bed that night as usual,
thinking the thoughts which meant much to him. These
thoughts were not about the house, but about a girl, whose
idea filled his inner life intensely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had thought his thoughts of this girl, as he always
did, when putting the day from him, and had then turned
over, to sleep as usual. He saw the stars overhead, through
a maze of the main-rigging: he heard the water go crooning
and gurgling by, and a man in the deckhouse beneath him
knock out his pipe; then instantly he was asleep, in a
sea-sleep, a depth of sleep, a million miles from this
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of his sleep he started up, an hour before dawn, with
that mansion by the sea lit up in his brain and words
ringing like prophecy in his ears:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will meet her again in that house, for the second of
the three times. It will be very, very important, so be
ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had risen up in the cold and dew of before dawn to
stare towards the house, almost expecting to see it lit with
angels; but it lay among its trees, barely visible. The dew
was dripping, the water crooning and the watchman
humming a song between his teeth. The cook was up
making coffee, for there was a light in the galley; everything
was as usual, except himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was so shaken with excitement that he gripped the
mizen stay to keep himself from leaping overboard to swim
to that lone beach. Then caution had come back upon him,
with the thought, “It will not be to-day; we are sailing
to-day; ‘it will be,’ the message said, not ‘it is’; I am
to stand by; it is all for the future, not for now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment the order came to call all hands; and by
daylight the <span class='it'>Venturer</span> was standing out from the northern
channel, while Sard cast loose the gaskets and shouted
“All gone the main-royal” to those on deck. For more
than nine years he saw no more of Las Palomas, but the
memory of his dream remained intense. The “first”
of the “three times” was the deepest thing in his life:
it made him shake, even to think of it: the hope of the
second time kept him alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then in February, 1897, he came again to Las Palomas,
this time as mate in the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>. Again he looked out
on Los Xicales, this time through a strong telescope from
the main top-gallant cross-trees. He saw the house unchanged
in all those years, save that it looked more battered.
When he could he went ashore, and walked northward
along the beach, over the tongue of red earth with the pine
trees, to the house itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found no barrier to his entrance to the grounds on
that side, save the close-growing thorny mita shrubs which
covered the low bank above the beach. Beyond the bank,
they had spread beach-shingle as a drive; the house rose
up out of the shingle white and withered against the blackness
of pines and the gloom of Spanish moss. It was a
pleasant, Southern mansion, less than twenty years old,
the worse for wear. It had a look of having come down in
the world, or rather, that staring look of having come
past its best, which houses share with men and flowers:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“This neither is its courage nor its choice</p>
<p class='line0'>But its necessity, in being old.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>It had a look of having no heir, and of being the last of
the family. It had not been painted since its builders left
it nineteen years before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was shuttered up tight, throughout; no smoke rose
from it; plainly everybody was away. He noticed big
leaden urns near the blistered green verandah. They were
filled with a sprawling trailer about to blossom. He
thought, “These are probably rare flowers, brought here
when the house was new, when the owner thought that he
would be a success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared at the house, thinking that there he was at
last, after all those years, there at the house of his dream,
where he was to meet her for the second time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, on the excitement of being there, after all
those years, after his mind had gone alone so often to
where he stood, came the disappointment, of finding the
house shut up, with no one there. He had half-expected
and wholly hoped to have found her outside the house,
looking for his coming. Hope and expectation were
dashed. The house was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feeling that he was trespassing, he walked to the western
side of the house, climbed the stone steps and rang the bell,
which gave forth a jangle far away to his left. No one
answered the bell, though he rang a second time. Little
scraps of plaster were scaling off the wall by the bell-pull;
the forest behind the house needed cutting back: it was
coming too close with its evil and its darkness. The noise of
its sighing was like the whispering of heirs about a death-bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not to meet her here this time,” he said to himself;
“but since she may live here or have been here, I will go all
round it, so that I may know what she has known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found that it ran, roughly, north and south, parallel
with the beach. It had an old green verandah on the sides
looking on the sea; the stone perron and steps on the west,
and out-houses, on which the jungle was encroaching, to
the north. On the north side was a path, which seemed to
be still in use: it led through an iron gate, which was open,
as though to invite him on. He passed through it, into a
jungle of evergreens, in which he heard the noise of water.
In a few minutes he came out on to a causeway of stone
which led over swampy ground to a pier or quay, on the
bank of a river which curved out into the sea there. The
pavement continued inland upstream along the bank of the
river till the forest hid it from sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As all water interests a sailor, Sard stopped on the bank
to watch this river. It came round a curve out of the forest,
broadened suddenly to a width of thirty yards, and went
babbling in a shallow over the sands into the sea. It was
like listening to poetry to hear it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They had this place a harbour once,” Sard thought,
“and boats loaded produce here. Then, in some flood,
the other side of the harbour was washed away: there is a
bit of a pier of masonry still standing: and they were never
able to afford to repair it. This river makes the northern
boundary of the estate, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stayed, watching the water so intently that he never
saw the approach of a woman, coming from the forest along
the path by the riverside. He looked up suddenly and
found a tall old proud-looking negress within a few feet of
him. She was dressed in black, she wore a mantilla over
her shoulders, and a big straw Gainsborough hat upon her
head. She wore very heavy old silver earrings in her ears,
which were small. Her nose was small; her face was
sharply and cleanly cut; she walked like an empress; she
had race in every line of her. She carried a small basket,
which Sard judged to contain eggs or meat. She seemed
at once both to resent and to ignore Sard’s presence there.
Sard saluted her, and asked her whether he could
reach a road to Las Palomas by continuing along the
river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said. “But if you will come with me by the
house, it will be a shorter way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led Sard back along his path; presently they were in
sight of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam,” Sard said, “who lives in this house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is closed at present. I live here with my husband.
I am Tia Eusebia, the caretaker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose house is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the house of General Martinez, who is away in the
South.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been a beautiful house. Is General Martinez
married? Has he children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God has willed that the General should be alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will he return?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who knows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time they were at the northern end of the house
where there was a small door. Tia Eusebia brought out
her door-key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See,” she said, “since you want the road to Las
Palomas, continue past the house; turn to the right near
the front door, up the drive to the lodge. The gates are
locked, but you can pass. If you then turn to the left,
you will be upon the road to the North Gate of Las Palomas,
which is distant, by the savannah, a league; but, by the
seashore, less.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you indeed, Madam, for your guidance,” Sard
said. “And now will you tell me yet one thing more?
Do you know of one, Señorita de la Torre, who has been to
this house, or is now here or to come here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De la Torre?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Señorita Juanita de la Torre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God has neither brought nor promised such,” she said.
“It is thought that some English may come here, but of no
such name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This lady is not English, but Spanish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she be young and beautiful, she will not come here,
Señor, where youth died long ago and beauty withered.
This is the house of the xicale flowers, brought from the
Indian country by the General, for his love, who died before
she saw them, and for his son, who died before they
flowered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They flower for others, Señora,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Others do not taste with my tongue,” she said. “But
since God favours others, it is enough. Vaya con Dios,
Señor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adios, Señora.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went, as she had told him, up the drive to the lodge,
which was ruinous but inhabited, since a negro child was
crying in it. The gates were locked, as she had said, but
he could pass by a gap in the fence into the road. The
fence was mainly gap: it might have been said that the
gaps had fence in them. The forest shut in the road, which
went on the right hand (as he judged) to a bridge over the
river, and on the left hand to the savannah and Las
Palomas. Sard walked back to Las Palomas and went on
board his ship to his cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting there, on his red velvet settle, he wondered what
it all meant. On an unforgettable day fourteen years
before, when he was a boy, he had met a girl, who had
changed his life for him. He had met her by a succession
of chances and had never seen her since. Four years
later, he had been told in a dream, such as no one
could neglect, that he would meet the girl again at Los
Xicales.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the dream, life had kept him away from following
his fancy: he had had to serve his time and make his way.
Five years after the dream, he had been free for a while:
he had gone to Spain to look for the girl, but had found no
trace of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now that I come to Los Xicales,” he said, “I find
the house shut up and her name not known. Whenever I
hope to make this more than a dream, it goes to nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked from his ports upon the deck of the ship. He
told himself that he was a grown man who ought not to let
himself be swayed by a dream. “As for the girl,” he told
himself, “she is dead or has forgotten, or is where I shall
never see her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will put her right out of my mind,” he said. He
tried to interest himself in a book, but found it impossible.
“I cannot put her out of my mind,” he said. “She is all
twined into it and part of it. And the dream tells truth.
Probably she is at Los Xicales now and needs my help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As this thought was unbearable, he went ashore again to
make sure. “She will be there this time,” he told himself.
“Beyond all doubt she will be there this time.” Presently
he was at the lodge gates, making sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the lodge, a negro child was still crying. A very tall,
lean, pale negro was sitting on the edge of the lodge’s
verandah-stoop, plaiting a withy-basket. Sard hailed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has a Spanish lady come to this house to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she at the house now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is her name, do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is her name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is her name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Sard said, “what is her name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The name she is called by: her surname.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lady’s name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which name? There’s so many names.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The name of the Spanish lady who came to this house
to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” the man said, “the name of the lady who came to
this house to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that is what I want to know; what is her name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” the negro said; “now I know what you want.
I didn’t know for the first moment what you asked me
about, but now I know. Oh, yes, sir. Look, sir, I’m
making a basket:</p>

<p class='line0'>Jesus in the air .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Sir, forgive my asking, but have you a little bit of tobacco
or a god-dam cigarette?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Sard said, “I have not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want here, sir?” the man asked. “What
do you come to this house for? This is General Martinez’
house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I understand,” Sard said. “I want to know the
name of the lady who came to this house to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord, are you American?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were an American, because you talked
such funny language.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the name of the lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no lady here, sir; the lady died a hundred
years ago. Oh, say, the lovely yellow candles, and the
priest he go Do diddy diddy oh do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there is no lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All put into the grave: ring a bell: Do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anyone at the house at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All in the grave. Do. Ring the bell. Do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A square-faced man, riding sideways on a heavily-laden
mule, stopped in the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” he said to Sard, “can I be of service to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” Sard said. “Can you tell me if any Spanish
lady came, or is coming, to this house to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The house is shut up, sir. No one will come to this
house for some weeks. I, who am Paco, know this, since
I have this day talked with Ramón, the caretaker of the
General. It may be that in some weeks’ time, when the
English, who are to be here, have come, Tio Ramón may
know more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard thanked him and walked on; he came to a little
bridge over the river, crossed it, and continued through the
forest for half a mile, when he came to a cleared patch where
a forge stood beside the road with an inn (of sorts) alongside
it. Here a grey old Italian, who said that his name was
Enobbio, confirmed what Paco had said: the house of
Los Xicales was shut up, in the care of Tio Ramón and his
wife Eusebia: no visitor would come there for some weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard thanked him and returned to his ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There it is,” he said, when he stood once more in his
cabin. “This thing has no foundation in fact, but it has
the power to make me do stupid things. I will not go
ashore again, unless I have some certain tidings to take me
there. This love has led me elsewhere in the past: it
must not lead to folly now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His room was light enough to show how little his love
had led him to folly in the past. He was a tall lean muscular
man in hard condition, sunburnt to the colour of a Red
Indian. His hair was black, very fine and worn a little
long (to shore eyes). He was clean-shaven and his face was
a clear brown with blood in it. Wind and sun puckers
made his look hawklike. His hands were big and fine. He
was always choicely and subtly well-dressed. Everything
about him was fastidious, to the point of keeping people
aloof and afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His room contained many books, for he was deeply read
in his profession and in the sciences allied to it. He spoke
the four languages which he reckoned to be necessary in
his profession. French, German and Norwegian he had
learned from intelligent shipmates as a lad: Spanish he
had learned more thoroughly, since it was “her” native
tongue. He had read not widely but choicely in all these
tongues. In English he cared deeply for only one literary
period, from the coming of Dryden to the death of Doctor
Johnson. A flute and the music of that time amused his
odd moments. He had taught himself to make accurate
drawings of things which interested him. His sketch books
contained much that would be valuable now to historians of
that old way of life:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The forepeak of the <span class='it'>Venturer</span> at 3 a.m., March 3rd,
1889, after collision with the <span class='it'>Tuggranong</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The main top-gallant parral goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The following sea. June 16th, 1891,” etc., etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the bulkheads of his room were standard and aneroid
barometers given to him by the Meteorological Society,
with other instruments, for the excellence of his meteorological
records.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked round these things, with the thought that they
were not life, but the solace of loneliness. He felt as lonely
as a captain. “I’ll go no more ashore,” he thought, “I’ll
spend my time teaching the boys Spanish. Huskisson has
a gift for languages: he ought not to be at sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not go ashore again, but thought, day after day,
that before he sailed he would perhaps go. As the time
passed, the thought that he was a fool to be swayed thus
by dreams kept him on board. In five more weeks the
<span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> got her hatches on, although light, ready to
drop down to leeward to Santa Barbara to complete with
sugar for home. It was the evening of the 18th March,
1897: the tug was to be alongside early the next morning,
to tow her clear of the Rip-Raps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be just ten years to a day,” Sard said, “at five
to-morrow morning, since that dream was a fire in my soul;
but all the same, I will not go ashore; this inner life of
mine shall fool me no longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed the evening making his room all ready for sea-fight,
for the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> was a lively ship when not loaded
down to her marks. When all was stowed and chocked, he
took his flute and played some of the airs printed in
D’Urfey’s “Pills to Purge Melancholy.” He was not more
than a competent player, but the night and the water gave
a magic to his fluting. The men came aft as far as the
waist and hung in a body there,</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>At about ten o’clock, knowing that he was to be on deck
at daybreak, he turned in. He heard Captain Cary, in
the chart-house on deck, call the steward for his nightcap;
he heard the steward go, and the spoon chink in the glass.
Then the watchman went shuffling forward from the main
hatch, tapping out his pipe. The sea gurgled down the
side, then life was shut off as by the turning of a tap, he
was asleep in a sea-sleep, dead to the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of his sleep he started up, an hour before dawn, with
the knowledge that a gigantic cock of fire was bursting out
of clouds and crowing:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day, to-day, to-day, for the second of the three
times, O be ready, O be ready, O be ready; at the house
of the xicale flowers; to-day, to-day, to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly the crowing of the cock and the image of the
house were merged in the memory of the first time, so that
all was burning with the idea of her. He leaped up, for
all these things were real, in his room, there, as it seemed,
to be touched and caught. He saw them slowly fade
from him, die away, not as it seemed, into his brain, but out
of his three forward ports into the greyness of morning.
He followed them till his brow was pressed on the brass
rim of one of the ports. There was nothing beyond but
the deck, the hatch, the bulk of the mainmast made darker
by the mizen staysail, and the noise of the dropping of
dew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day,” he said, “to-day. Why, we sail to-day.
We shall be gone in two hours, far out of this, and God
knows if I shall ever be here again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then. I will go ashore. I will leave ship
and sea, so as not to fail her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot do that,” he added, “I am tied, both to
Captain Cary and to the ship. I shall sail at daybreak.
I must get on deck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was but a step from his cabin door to the deck. He
stood beneath the break of the poop, looking out upon the
dimness; he heard the cocks crowing ashore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll put these dreams in their place,” he said to himself.
“But when they come, they are shaking experiences.
As long as I know that they mean nothing, I can steer a
compass course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He brought a towel to the waist, stripped and called the
watchman to pour some buckets of salt water over him.
As he dressed in his cabin afterwards, the steward brought
him some coffee; he carried it out on deck, and heard the
cocks crowing far inland in clearings of the forest. “It is
a marvellous noise,” he muttered; “they shout for the
sun before there is a glimmer, and the sun comes. To-day,
to-day, to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deck was wet with dew, which was dripping from the
eaves of the deckhouses. The port was not yet awake,
though lights were burning. The ship was awake: there
was a light at the galley door; the boatswain was standing
there, yarning with the cook; and from time to time a
drowsy man shambled into the light from forward to fetch
coffee or to ask a light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard put his cup between two pins and stared at the line
of the coast to the north of the town, some two or three
miles from him. There, in the dimness of the dawn, the
white of Los Xicales just showed against the blackness of
the forest. He looked at it intently. It was one small
patch of paleness, becoming clearer from minute to minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is it,” he said to himself. “I’ve thought of it
every day for ten years, and stared at it ever since we
moored, and been to it twice; and now that I am sailing
I am warned again that I am to meet her there again. I
am warned just as I was warned ten years ago, on this very
day of the year, at this very time of the day, in this very
berth of Las Palomas, just as I was sailing as I am to-day,
for Santa Barbara, on that cruise when we saved Don
Manuel. The second of the three times is to be to-day and
I am to be ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking over the water at the house, the emotion which
had woken him surged back upon him, so that he had to
grip the pins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all madness,” he said. “A man must go by
intellect and will. These dreams fight against both. Life
has settled the matter: I am not to meet her. My task
here is to sail this ship wherever the old man bids me.
Now I will do my task.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked forward to the port half deck door where
the boys stood waiting for a call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On deck; turn-to here. Get the colours up, ready
for bending, two of you,” he said. “Huskisson, get the
Blue Peter.” As they came trooping out behind him, he
turned to the boatswain, who was hanging about in the
waist waiting for the word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rig the head-pump,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rig the head-pump, sir,” the boatswain said. “Head-pump
there, two of you. Beg pardon, sir, shall we be
heaving in, after washing down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dorney, the third mate, drove some of the boys forward
with an accent from the northern midlands. “Now,
choom Jellybags,” he said, “get tha boockets; and Nibs
and Woolfram get tha scroobers. We want a good harbour
scroob for sailing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dorney was a rougher customer than the other
mates, but a faultless practical seaman. He would have
made a perfect boatswain. Anything to be done with
hands (especially a dangerous thing) was Mr. Dorney’s
delight. He had a heavy, loutish, expressionless face,
which seemed to have been badly carved out of pale wood.
He had only scraped through his navigation examinations
after three attempts. “Ah haate all this fooss of sights,”
he said. “Ah can foodge a day’s work.” In any emergency
he was as swift as Sard himself, but his excellence
stopped at seamanship: he was a coastwise seaman who
had strayed into blue water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a minute or two Sard was forward with his watch,
setting the pace in washing decks against the second mate.
He had rolled up his trousers to the knee and worked
barefooted in advance of the scrubbers, scattering sand
for them to scrub with, then snatching buckets from the
water-carriers to sluice the portion scrubbed. By the
time his watch had worked aft to the main hatch, he was
five yards ahead of the second mate. There came a hail
from a water-boat going past them to the outer anchorage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pathfinders ahoy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard went to the rail to take the hail. The water-boat
was going dead slow, as though only half awake. She still
carried her navigation lights, but men were taking them in
and blowing them out as she paused to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pathfinder ahoy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, the water-boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your tug won’t be alongside till six this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At six this evening! Why not this morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s blown some of her god-dam guts out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having her guts done at Ytá-Ytá.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell Captain Cary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, Mister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>Otoque</span> will be in. You’ll get your mail before you
sail. So long, Mister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long, Mister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard slipped on shoes, unrolled his trousers and went to
report to Captain Cary, who was sitting bolt upright
in a chair in his chart-room, being shaved by his
steward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The tug has broken down, sir. She can’t be alongside
till six this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who said this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The skipper of the water-boat, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Harker. Mr. Harker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall wait for her. I won’t try the Rip-Raps without
a tug. Carry on with your brass work and bright work.
Stay one moment, I’ve got something to say to you, Mr.
Harker. I believe you used to be fond of boxing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The agents gave me some tickets the other night, for a
sort of an assault-at-arms this afternoon. Since we are
not to sail, perhaps you would like to take them, and go,
after dinner this afternoon. Would you like to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir. Yes; very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then oblige me by taking the tickets. Steward, find
the tickets for Mr. Harker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are they, Captain Cary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you to find them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good, Captain Cary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were in the pocket of the Captain’s go-ashore
coat. They were handed over to Sard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can take your own time, of course, Mr. Harker,”
the captain said. “Let me see, you never got ashore here
in the <span class='it'>Venturer</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I think you were only ashore once this time since
the anchors were down. You ought to see the place; not
that there’s anything to see: so stay out of the ship if you
wish, till the tug’s alongside. I have always gone by the
maxim, Mr. Harker, that one ought to see everything that
one has the chance of seeing; because in life not many
have one chance and none has two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Captain Cary. Are we to heave in, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not till this afternoon, Mr. Harker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Captain Cary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard returned to the deck to finish the washing down.
He had the running rigging thrown from the pins and
recoiled: he had the men to the brasswork; saw the
colours up and the house flag and Blue Peter hoisted.
Captain Cary was on deck by a quarter to eight with an
eye like a hawk for a spot or a started rope yarn. Sard at
that moment was at the windlass with the carpenter.
Coming out, he cast a glance aft and a glance aloft, with
the thought that for all that magnificent thing, the ship, he
was the man responsible, and that she would stand even
Captain Cary’s eye. “She is in good order,” he thought,
“she can stand anything that the sea can send. There’s
nothing wrong with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was indeed beautiful, even from forward, looking
aft. The power of her sheer made a sailor catch his breath.
She was not very lofty, but her yards were very square:
her spread was huge. She was in lovely order; yards
squared, harbour-stowed, all the chafing gear bran-new,
and the decks already sea-shape. He sent a boy aloft to
dip a rope clear, and then went aft, with an eye for everything
and the knowledge that the ship was fit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he went aft, he stopped just abaft the fo’c’sle (the
forward deckhouse) to have another look at her. He never
realised how much he liked his work until just before it was
tested. He looked up at her great steel masts with the
enormous yards (the fore and main yards together, end
for end, as long as three cricket pitches) with the thought
that this was art, this iron shell, with her gear, and that he
was the master of this art. “It’s a good framework,” he
thought, “a good foundation. Building a steeple is only
going a little further in the same direction, and building a
steeple is the finest thing a man can do. But a steeple is
based on rock and this thing flies along water. This thing
works for her living.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped abreast of the main-rigging to have a word
with “Pompey” Hopkins, the second mate, a fair-haired,
snub-nosed man of twenty-three, whose sea career he had
watched from its beginning. He was called “Pompey”
because he came from Portsmouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any chance of a Liverpool leave, Mr. Harker, since we
are not to sail?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None, Mister,” Sard said; “you know the old man by
this time, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall we be doing, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After breakfast he will have a look-see and decide to
trim her by the head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I used to think sugar was a food,” Pompey said, “but
now I know that it’s a poison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard left the deck in charge of Pompey and went below
to make ready for breakfast. He had been too busy ever
since dawn to think of his own affairs, but down in his
cabin the words of the warnings rang again in his brain:
“You will meet her again in that house: it will be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
very, very important.” And deep within his mind a voice
seemed speaking: “You, who did not believe, see what has
been done for you. The way has been cleared for you to
go ashore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he thought, “I shall be ashore by two bells. I
could go to the house before the boxing. I shall be free
here for five hours, when I expected to be out at sea. All
the same, I am not ashore yet. Captain Cary may change
his mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the last two years he had noticed old age, “with
crawling clutch,” laying hold of Captain Cary. One of
its results was an old-maidish inquisitiveness about his
officers’ doings ashore; a desire to screen them from
“temptation.” This was easily to be understood, since he
had himself trained all his officers from their first coming
to sea, but it was trying to grown men. Sard knew that
Captain Cary looked upon him partly as a favourite chick,
a prize hatching from a clutch who had become “my mate,”
or “my chief officer,” or “my Mr. Harker,” but that
mainly Captain Cary still thought of him as a boy in the
half deck, whose morals must be watched in port. “I
know,” he muttered, “the old man will say something at
breakfast that will check my movements ashore. He
won’t give me absolute liberty on the day of sailing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went into the long narrow cabin, that was painted
white fore and aft; little shields painted with blue and
white stripes were on all the doors opening into this cabin.
A clock and a tell-tale compass were under the skylight, set
into the coamings. All round the after bulkhead were
stands of arms, old Snider rifles, bayonets, boarding pikes,
tomahawks and cutlasses, all shining like stars. On the
table were six red geraniums in pots. The table shone
with electro-plated ware, for Captain Cary kept a style.
He was at the head of the table in clean white drills. The
old steward stood at attention beside him. Sard took his
seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At breakfast, Captain Cary, after feeding his canaries,
talked of the pleasure of getting away to sea with a full
crew. “When my brother was here in the <span class='it'>Lolita</span> in ’79, in
the beginning of the gold-rush, everybody left her, except
his boatswain, and none of them came back, except one of
the boys, a lad of the name of Jenkins, who had a lump of
gold as big as one hand, done up in a handkerchief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope, sir, that your brother charged Jenkins bullion-rates
for freightage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mr. Harker; he gave him the end of a brace for
going out of the ship. And Jenkins went ashore in the
ship’s dinghy that night and never went aboard again. He
started one of these low dance-and-cigar divans; there
used to be too many of them. He married one of these
greaser women after, but I never heard that he did much
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did your brother get a crew, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; when some of the gold-diggers had had enough
of it; or too much, as often happened, for there were
Indians, then, in the foothill country, seventy miles from
here. When I was here myself, in ’74 or ’75, you could see
the Indian bucks riding their ponies. You could get your
hair cut for nothing outside the walls after nightfall in
those days. You can get your throat cut for nothing inside
the walls in these days, for the matter of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. I hear, sir, that that is because the rum-smugglers
have been landing their cargoes along the coast
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a great deal too much lawlessness all along this
coast, Mr. Harker, and it is all coming here from outside.
Your Occidental is a quiet, hard-working man, or used to be,
as I remember, but a breed of hard cases has got loose here
out of some jail, or every jail in Europe by the look of them,
and Las Palomas is not Occidental any longer. You
couldn’t give the people liberty here, even on Sunday, not
even just to go to the church ship and back. The place is
a sink of iniquity. Mr. Hopkins, have you seen the Mission
Church here? It is very remarkable; that is, it is said to
be by those who know, for its paintings of the Last Judgment.
I was thinking of sending you ashore this morning,
to see them—since we are not to sail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir; thank you very much, sir,” the second
mate answered. The captain turned up his eyes as though
he were watching a bird through the skylight: he reddened
and gurgled in his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard, who knew the symptoms, stole a glance at Pompey
Hopkins, caught his eye and gave him the flutter of a smile.
Pompey was another lad who had served all his seven years
at sea under Captain Cary; he, too, was still a boy, in the
captain’s eyes, to be guarded from the sins of a seaport
town. Sard and he both saw the thought slowly crystallising
in their captain’s mind:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I send this boy to one of these foreign churches, he
may be caught by this foreign way of worship and fall into
all kinds of sin: it is just devil-worship by what I understand
of it. He had better stay on board and do some
useful work.” In a few seconds the captain’s voice was
heard again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking that, Mr. Hopkins; that I would send
you ashore this morning; but I’m not at all satisfied with
her trim. When we are riding light, as we shall be this
time, I like her to be more by the head. I will just have a
look-see, as the Chinese say, from the dinghy after breakfast,
and if it’s as I think, Mr. Harker, you will have the
people down and see if we can’t get her down more. She
lies a much better course in a light wind when she is by the
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, too, Mr. Harker, that since we are so light,
we’ll have the main-royal mast down on deck. And let
the boys do it all, will you, with yourself and old Birkett.
Since ships became big, they do not get the practice in
these things which we used to have. I remember when
people came down to the water-front to see a ship of seven
hundred tons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir: do you indeed, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, and ships of the line sent down top-gallant
yards at dusk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pompey Hopkins’ face expressed due wonder, with the
inner reservation that “this kind of thing was the old man’s
perk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little more kedgeree, Mr. Hopkins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steward, have the goodness to give Mr. Hopkins a
little more kedgeree. About this kedgeree, Mr. Harker:
they call the fish Pompano ashore here at Las Palomas,
but it is not the true Pompano, which is the great delicacy
at New Orleans, but more of a salt-water shad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s in a name, Captain Cary? It is a credit to
any name. What is the true Pompano like, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know, Mr. Harker, I never tasted it. I saw
it in the boats at the levees, when I was there, but I was
there in a fever season, and many people thought that the
fever was spread by the fish; for it seemed to hang about
the water-front. It is difficult to account for the fever in
any other way. We lost seven men of the fever. They
went ashore one night to bring down some scantlings we
were in need of, and they all partook of this Pompano in
one of these negro fish-joints, and they all afterwards
sickened and died. I tell you these things, gentlemen,
because you will one day command ship’s companies, and
it is right that you should know to what you may expose
them, when you send them on shore, even upon necessary
duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, indeed,” Sard said, knowing that his turn was
now come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since the tug will not be alongside until six, Mr. Harker,
I think that if you have no objection, I will accompany you
ashore myself. I understand that this boxing contest is
something more than one of these low-class fighting-den
affairs; it is an affair of two athletes in a real gymnasium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be very proud, sir, if you will come with me,” Sard
said. His heart had sunk at the thought, for it meant that
he would have no chance whatever of going out to the house
as he had hoped; but he was sincere when he said that he
would be proud if the captain would come with him.
Captain Cary was not only famous but most eminent in his
profession. He was</p>

<p class='noindent'>of the song of thirty years before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the old <span class='it'>Petrella</span>, when I had her,” Captain Cary said,
“we had two athletes forward. I felt that they took an
undue position in the fo’c’sle. When we reached Sydney,
I bought some sets of boxing-gloves and caused them to
teach boxing to all hands for a plug of tobacco a hand. By
the time we left China, there were six or seven men in each
watch able to deal with them. I shall be glad to see some
boxing again. I understand that you box, Mr. Harker?
I think that I used to see you box when we went to Auckland
that time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, I used to box a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steward, will you have the goodness to set out my
shore-suit presently? I shall go ashore after coffee after
dinner with Mr. Harker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good, Captain Cary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will explain the different blows to me, Mr. Harker.
I have never boxed, myself, but I have sometimes had to
hit men. The principle I have always gone upon is, to be
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a very sound principle, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After breakfast, Captain Cary had his look-see from the
dinghy, and as a result of it Mr. Hopkins went below with
the hands to trim her by the head. Sard, with the third
mate and the best of the boys, got the main-royal mast
down on deck. He himself went to the top-gallant cross-trees
at the beginning of the work. Up there in the wind
he had a good view of Los Xicales. There it was, white,
shining and mysterious. “You are mixed up with my
life,” Sard muttered, “and as far as I can foresee, I shall
not find out why even this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was aloft, he saw a big barquentine-rigged
steam yacht come smartly in to the steamship anchorage
and let go her anchor. She was of about six hundred tons,
and this and the fact that she was flying the blue ensign,
told him that she was the <span class='it'>Yuba</span>. He pointed her out to
Borleigh, one of the boys there. “There is the <span class='it'>Yuba</span>,
Sir James’s yacht, that went round the world, and then
went back the other way to take the turn out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At dinner Captain Cary was uneasy about the weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we’re in for a norther,” he said. “The air’s got
that bright look and the glass is falling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking that, sir,” Sard said. “It’s a bit
plumy and whitish over El Cobre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh? Whitish, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like the idea of a norther in Las Palomas,”
Captain Cary said. “I’d like to be out of it and clear of
the Rip-Raps before it comes on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ought to be well clear of the Rip-Raps, sir, by eight
bells.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be glad of it, Mr. Harker,” Captain Cary said,
“because I was here in the big norther of ’74—or was it
’75?—perhaps it was ’75. Seven ships went ashore: they
drove, as we used to say, from Hell to Hackney. We did
not go ashore, but we lost all three topmasts, and the sea
made a clean breach on deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this shallow Golfe the sea gets up very quick, and is
very short and very dangerous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However,” he added, “it seems to be coming on
slowly. I dare say we shall be gone in plenty of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner, Captain Cary took Sard to the boxing-match.
He took him in style, going first to the agents,
then to the gymnasium, in a one-horse caleche hired on the
water-front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gymnasium lay at a little distance from that part of
Las Palomas to be seen from the ships. It was in the
Ciudad Nueva, or New Town, on the slopes of savannah
which led to the mountains, in a garden of palm, cactus
and plumbago. In itself, it was remarkable, being an
arena, a Circo Romano, as the Greek who kept it called it,
built of limewashed adobe. When Sard had entered in
with his captain, they both felt that they were in an arena of
old Rome about to watch some gladiators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, of course, no roof to it. It looked like a
small circus ring surrounded by tiers of wooden seats.
Inside the circus ring was a square platform on which a
boxing-ring was pitched. The two sailors were shown to
seats near the ring, but with one row of vacant seats
between them and it. Their seats, being White Men’s
Seats, were screened from the sun by an old green-and-white
striped awning. From under this awning they could
see the sky, intensely blue, the Coloured Men in the opposite
seats, some palms rattling the metal of their leaves, and
grasses, sprouted in the tiles on the adobe top, being
hovered over by black and scarlet butterflies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mr. Harker,” Captain Cary said, “we seem to be
in plenty of time. Since you know Spanish so well, here’s
one of their programmes or bills of fare. You might read
it over and let me know what it is that we are to expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard took the sheet of coarse yellowish paper printed in
blunt old type which had once printed praise of Maximilian.
He read from it as follows:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line'>Grand Feast of Pugilism.</p>
<p class='line'>At three o’clock punctually.”</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“H’m!” Captain Cary said, “it’s nearly three now.
They evidently won’t begin very punctually, for we are
almost the only white people here. We might have had
time to go down the south end of the water-front to see
that new floating dock they’ve got there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we go, then, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It’s too late now. We’re here now. We may
as well stay here now we are here. It’s a dock badly
needed in Las Palomas and I wanted to see it. It’s like
the one they have at San Agostino.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat talking while they waited, but there was always
a professional restraint about their talk. Captain Cary
ashore was still “the old man,” Sard Harker, the mate,
was still, in the captain’s eyes, the boy whom he had taught
to steer. Both found themselves staring ahead over the
further wall of the arena, at the old Spanish fortifications
as white as spray beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a pounce and squeal in the air just over the
open ring. There were excited cries from the negroes,
the wail died out and a few feathers drifted down into the
ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” Captain Cary asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hawk, sir; it came down and struck and carried
away a little bird just over the ring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what they call an omen of something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An omen that the better fighter is going to win, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were still almost the only whites in the arena.
They chatted or were silent while the other side of the arena
filled up with negroes and half-breeds who had come to
cheer the Carib. Many of these, being young men, were
dressed in what was then the extreme fashion among the
coloured peoples. This fashion was based on the belief
that youth is irresistible: it dressed men to look young.
That there might be no doubt about it, the costumes chosen
were those of little boys of six or seven years of age. About
a hundred of the young bloods of Las Palomas were wearing
little round straw sailor hats, with ribbons hanging from
the bands over their faces. On their bodies they wore little
sailor suits, with flopping collars and very short knickerbockers.
Their legs were mostly bare from above the knee
to the ankle. Little white socks and tennis shoes covered
their feet. Had they carried little spades and buckets,
they would have looked like little boys dressed for the seashore.
As it was, they carried little parasols of red and blue
stuff: many of them had opened these and sat beneath
them in their places: the rest carried fans or handkerchiefs
of bright colours. They were exceedingly noisy and merry:
they seemed to make the arena-side to flash with their teeth.
Until about twenty minutes past three, many of them
shouted insults at the two whites, who sat unmoved, not
knowing the debased dialect of the Occidental. After
twenty minutes past three, many white men entered: the
insults stopped, a drummer, a zither-player and a bone-rattler
struck up a jig to which the negroes kept time with
Hues and stamping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very late in beginning,” Captain Cary complained.
“It is half-past three now. If they mention a time, they
ought to keep to it. They used not to be like this in the
Occidental. They used to be people of their words, like
the Chinese. But they have lost their religion since they
began to make their fortunes, and now they are regular
hasta mañana people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will not be long now, Captain Cary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to have known that they would be thoroughly
late. We could have gone to the dock and then we could
have gone to the cutting and seen the new steam-shovel
that they talk about. That would have done us more good
than sitting here all this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things seem to be beginning to move now, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, things were beginning to move, for the bone-rattler
had roused two negroes to leap into the ring to
step-dance. This they did with extraordinary skill and
invention against each other, among Hues and laughter.
All the negroes present kept time with their feet to the slap
and rattle of the dancers’ feet. The little boy bloods
sang songs. Lemonade-sellers came round with drinks;
cake-and-sweetmeat men, each in a cloud of flies, sold
sticky messes for pennies. Then two men standing at the
ringside with guitars, began to sing in falsetto about the
cruelty of love; and a littleish skilly-faced man, whose
head, having been clipped for ringworm, had a look of
prison, offered to reveal the result of the big fight for a half
peseta down. The Angel Gabriel had revealed the matter
to him in a vision, so he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Cary became silent as was his way when vexed.
Sard was left with his own thoughts, which were of “her”
and of his chances of getting to the house, as he meant,
before he left the shore. His mind went over various
schemes for getting rid of Captain Cary, but none seemed
very hopeful. “He will have to come along,” he thought,
“and at half-past four at the latest, I shall go from here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the hope of meeting her merged in his mind into
an expectation of meeting her, in perhaps less than two
hours. All his life, since he had met her as a boy, when
sex was beginning to be powerful in him, had been a hope
of meeting her again by some divine appointment. He
was weary of waiting and waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was also weary of loneliness, for he was as lonely as a
captain, although he had not yet come into command.
He was the most hated, feared, and respected man he knew:
men were afraid and boys terrified of him. He knew what
was said of him: “He is not a companion ashore and sets
too high a standard afloat.” “He’s a damned sardonic
devil with a damned sardonic way.” “He may be a good
sailor, but he’s an ass with it, staying on in sail, and he
hasn’t a friend between Hull and Hades.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had, however, two friends, an Australian surgeon,
whom he had met in Sydney, and a friar whom he had met
in the Church of Saint John Lateran in Rome, during his
one real holiday. That gaunt and burning soul, the friar,
was the likest to himself in all the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women he hardly spoke with from year’s end to year’s
end. He had not been six months ashore in eleven years.
His mother was alive, but they had not been good friends
since her second marriage; he disliked his stepfather.
The second marriage had been much of a shock to him in
many ways. His only woman friend was an austere old
lady with a gaunt and glittering mind, of whom he had been
fond ever since his childhood. This was Agatha, Lady
Crowmarsh, who lived in Berkshire. She was very proud
of Sard and was ambitious for him in her own way and
world, which were not his. They used to spar when they
met, because he would not give up his power for her advantages.
She wished him to be a part of her world of ruling
families and permanent officials. He wanted to be himself,
pitted against the forces which he understood, in a world
of elements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting in the arena waiting for these boxers, he asked
himself what his future held for him. How long was he
going to be “an ass with it, staying on in sail?” He had
indeed “passed in steam,” but there was something hateful
to him in the thought of steam. It meant being subject
to an engine-room: it came down to that: which seemed
a fall after being a master of two elements on the deck of a
clipper-ship. He knew very well that the sailing ship was
doomed. He had watched the struggle for ten years, and
had seen line after line give up the fight and “go into
steam.” The tea-clippers had gone before he came to
sea: the wool-clippers and big four-masters were being
squeezed out: they were starved and pinched and sent to
sea hungry, but even so they did not pay. “They can’t
pay,” he said to himself, “they ought not to pay: they
are anachronisms. The steamship is cheaper, bigger,
safer, surer, pleasanter, and wiser. The sailing ship is
doomed and has to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that his own owners, Wrattson and Willis,
were feeling the pinch acutely, and that they were both
too old to change the habits of a lifetime in time to avail.
He had watched their struggle at close quarters, for their
struggle was passed on to their ships without delay. They
had been pinching their ships for some years; cutting
down the crews to danger-point; cutting their officers’
wages; making old gear serve till it was junk, and grudging
even a pint of oil for the decks. He had seen them become
mean. When he first went to sea, the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> had
carried four boys in the half deck: now she carried eleven.
Each paid twenty or thirty pounds for their three or four
years’ service; each did the work of an ordinary seaman,
and the better trained of them worked with the sailmaker
and made every sail they set. Yet all this would not
serve. The steamship was beating them in spite of it all,
and Wrattson and Willis were being squeezed out. There
was no doubt of it; the fleet was going. The <span class='it'>Venturer</span>
had been wrecked; the <span class='it'>Voyager</span> was being broken up;
the <span class='it'>Wayfarer</span> had been sold to the Norwegians; the
<span class='it'>Loiterer</span> had been sold to the Italians; the <span class='it'>Intruder</span> had
been sold to the Portuguese; the <span class='it'>Scatterer</span> was up for sale;
the <span class='it'>Messenger</span> and the <span class='it'>Roysterer</span> had been barque-rigged
and sent to the West Coast; the <span class='it'>Endeavourer</span> and <span class='it'>Discoverer</span>
were said to be going the same road; the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>,
the glory of the fleet, would surely follow before long: the
line would “go into steam,” or into liquidation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Cary spoke suddenly from the depths of his
silence, as though he had followed the same lines of thought
to another conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever see the <span class='it'>Petrella</span>, Mr. Harker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, I did; when she was lying for sale in the
George’s Dock, in 1885. I went all over her and over her
masthead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes. I think you have told me that. What did
you think of her, Mr. Harker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was a very sweet little ship, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We did not think her little, in the sixties, Mr. Harker.
She was 891 tons. We carried a crew of 43 men and boys:
sixteen hands to a watch: we could shorten her down to
her lower topsails, which we were the first to set, or among
the first, with the watch alone; or, if we had all the
stunsails set, and it happened to be daylight, with the
watch and the idlers. That is different from the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>,
Mr. Harker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, we have a harder time to compete with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A harder time,” Captain Cary said. “There is no
such thing as an easy time; but in life you are wanted or
not wanted; and the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> is not wanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say that, Captain Cary, a crack ship and captain
will always be wanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you believe it, boy”; Captain Cary always
called him a boy when he wished to silence all opposition.
“Don’t you believe it. What is passing out of this world
is the business of personal relations. Captain Wrattson
is a master mariner, Mr. Willis is a ship-designer with a
second mate’s ticket. When you go into their office you
see that they know you and the worth of your efforts for
them, and the difficulties you have faced for them. It is
all friend to friend, man to man, sailor to sailor, if you
understand what I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it was when I had the <span class='it'>Petrella</span>. Pennington and
Foster were like that: Fremantle and Henry: Waltham
and Binfields’, Shurlock Brothers, Richard Oakleys’, all
the old firms were like that: the Green Sleeves Line: they
were family affairs; an officer was a friend of the firm and
could marry the employer’s daughter. But that is gone,
or going: ships have become too big: they are not owned
by “firms” now: nothing’s firm in the business: they
are owned by companies; who don’t know one hand on
their paysheets. A company, as we say, has neither a
stern to be kicked nor a soul to be saved. It is a damned
abstraction, Mr. Harker, without either a mind to understand
or an eye to see: it has neither guts to scare nor
hands to shake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but, Captain Cary .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t answer me, boy: it is as I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bearings were plainly running hot, but luckily at
this instant there came wild Hues as the whole negro
audience rose to welcome the beginning of the boxing.
The old negro boxers, who were seconding the early bouts,
came to the ringside, pitched some much tattered gloves
into the ring and hoisted two backless chairs into opposite
corners. A couple of lanky lads, shivering in serapes,
climbed through the ropes to the chairs, were gloved and
introduced; then the gong struck and the bouts began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boxing, when it did begin, was fast and very skilful:
it roused the partisans in the coloured men’s benches to
fight with banana skins and half-sucked oranges. There
were five, not six “contests of the three rounds,” and only
one of the six went to the end of the third round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These lads are good at their business,” Captain Cary
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir; there are two or three fine clever lads among
those. That whitish-looking lad who beat the merry one,
would be a dangerous boxer if he were fit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I enjoyed that. It was like an English summer;
good when it came; but a long time on the road. Now I
suppose we shall have to wait again, for the big
fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the bouts of the boys, in the pause before the
coming of the heavy-weights, the better seats, which had
not been crowded, filled up with whites. Two men came
down the gangway and sidled into the vacant ring seats
just in front of the two sailors. One of them, who was
powerfully built, Sard judged (from his back) to be a likely
man, but when he saw his face he changed his mind: it
was a rotten face: the muscle had all gone to brothel with
the man’s soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His companion was a little, grey-bearded man, whose
neck was swathed with a rag which partly hid a boil. The
boil made him keep his head forward as he spoke. Both
men spoke English as they entered. They looked hard at
the two sailors for an instant before they sat down; then,
having made up their minds that they were just a couple of
English sailors, they sat and began to talk in Spanish,
which Sard knew very well. The little man talked rapidly
and much, using slang. Some of his front teeth were gone.
He had a way of drawing his breath sharply through the
gaps with a noise of relish. Sard reckoned that the
bigger man was a flash townee, the other, probably, a
fence. The little man was a spiteful little devil (perhaps
the boil was touching him up) with a way of rising in his
excitement to a kind of song. Sard thought him a horrid
little man, but likely to be clever in his own rather dirty
little way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, these negroes,” the little man said, in Spanish,
“they need to be fed into the hopper and be taught the
way again. They are getting too uppish to my liking. I
love my black brother, but I love him best with the toe of
a boot, to show him he’s got to go. Yes, sir, he’s got to go.
This is God’s country: it ain’t going to be any black man’s
not while little ’Arry Wiskey is on the tapis.</p>

<p class='noindent'>How long are these Dagoes going to keep us waiting?
We’re twenty minutes late as it is. Hasta mañana;
that’s always the way with these Dagoes. They got no
sense of the value of time, even the good ones. That’s
singing to their guitars instead of sound commercial
competition. We shall be late, setting out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s El Chico, anyway,” the other said. “And even
if it goes the twenty rounds, we shall have time enough for
Mr. Bloody Kingsborough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little man seemed scared at the mention of the name,
and glanced back, over his shoulder, to see whether either
Sard or Captain Cary had noticed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, Sumecta,” he said. “No names.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t understand Spanish,” Sumecta replied,
meaning Sard. “And if he does, what odds?” He
glanced back at Sard, whose face seemed intent upon the
Carib, then just entering the ring. Sumecta’s eyes
followed Sard’s to the Carib: he spat, turned to Mr. Wiskey
and said, in a low voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t have much show.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who, El Chico or Mr. K.?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I meant El Chico; but Mr. K. won’t have much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have much!” Mr. Wiskey answered; “he’ll have
about as much show as a cat in hell without claws. When
it’s peace, he has a show, but when it’s war, he’s got to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Carib pitched off his green wrapping, sat down upon
his chair and stretched out his legs for his seconds to
massage them. His reddish-brown skin moved with the
play of healthy muscle: he shone with health and oil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Mr. Wiskey muttered, staring at the Carib,
“you may listen and you may glisten, but you’ll go where
the nightshade twineth if you put the cross on little ’Arry
Wiskey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this is Chico,” the Captain said. “Well, Mr.
Harker, he looks to me liker a panther than a human
being. I must say that I do not like to see these cannibals
pitted against Christians. I am in two minds about
staying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, I expect he is as good a Christian as the other.
And he may not be nearly so good a fighter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True,” the Captain said. “The Church has lost its
hold here, as I was saying, but still I don’t think that even
these modern Occidentales would let a Carib fight a
Christian, if they thought that he stood a chance of winning.
Where is this other, the Christian? I think, Mr. Harker,
I will go get a cigar at the office, while this other man is
being made ready, if you will keep my seat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will keep your seat, Captain Cary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Captain Cary had edged away to buy a cigar, Sard
waited for the two men in front to go on with their talk,
for what they had said had interested him. He had not
liked to be ranked with any other mate who knew no
Spanish, and he wondered why Mr. Bloody Kingsborough
was to have no show. Who was Mr. Bloody Kingsborough?
He did not know the name. The tone in
which the name was pronounced suggested that Mr.
Kingsborough was judged to give himself airs. Sard
judged that if Mr. Kingsborough did not take good heed,
he would be a bloodier Mr. Kingsborough before dawn.
Chico was not to have much show in any case, but to have
none if he disappointed Mr. Wiskey. Sard hoped that the
talk would go on, but it did not. Mr. Wiskey began to
eat a pomegranate by tearing off the skin with his teeth and
spitting it out into the ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a dirty shining yellow snake,” he said at last in
English, meaning Chico; “Palm-oil all over him. It’s
that that gives them leprosy in their old age. Yah, you
dirty Carib,</p>

<p class='noindent'>That’s what’s coming to you in one dollar’s worth. The
royal order of the K.O., or else a boot you’ll feel for as long
as you can sit. Yet he looks a treat. If he could have
the yellow bleached out of him, he’d make a bit for a
manager, sparring exhibition bouts up West.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would that,” Sumecta said, also in English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s got the torso of a Greek god, as they say, though
which his torso is I never rightly understood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like you would say his physique.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The slimy yellow ounce-cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heya, Chico,” Sumecta called, “Chico!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Carib caught Sumecta’s eye. Sard was watching him
at the moment and saw a strange look of fear, or at least
anxiety, pass over the savage face. Sumecta opened his
mouth and tapped his teeth with his fingers: whatever the
sign may have meant, it made Chico smile uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Sard said to himself, “these two ruffians have
bought El Chico to lose the bout, and now that it comes to
the point, El Chico is scared of these buck negroes with
their razors. The whites will shoot him if he wins, and
the coloured men will skin him if he doesn’t. And who
is this Mr. Kingsborough who will not have much show,
and for whom there will be time enough? I wish that they
would say some more about Mr. Bloody Kingsborough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wiskey suddenly turned round upon Sard. He had
his head ducked down so as to avoid giving pain to his
boil, and the ducked-down dart of the skull gave the movement
something deadly, like the strike of a snake or ferret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a treat, sir, for looks, and a beautiful boxer, this
Chico, the Carib here,” he said to Sard. “Would you like
to have a friendly dollar on him, just to give an interest to
the proceedings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. I do not bet,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wiskey looked at him, but thought it better to be
quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite right, sir,” he said. “I respect your feelings.
I’m a gentleman myself and can appreciate them. They
do you credit, sir.” He turned round to the ring again,
took another wrench and spit from his pomegranate, bit
into the seeds and said something in a low voice, with a
full mouth in Spanish, to Sumecta, about “one of nature’s
bloody caballeros.” There was a chill upon the talk for
nearly a minute; then Sumecta turned round, had a look
at Sard, and surveyed the benches behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s old Abner,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the back row, about seven from the end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wiskey burst into song, parodying a familiar advertisement:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“He’s one of the party,</p>
<p class='line0'>Old Abner MacCarty,</p>
<p class='line0'>On the day of St. Patrick, at ten.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see Mr. Sagrado B.,” Sumecta said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not staying for the party: he’s off: out of it:
going by the briny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sort of thing he would do; mind his own skin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sound sense, too,” Mr. Wiskey said. “If a man won’t
mind his own skin, there’s darned little he will mind, and no
one else will mind it for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Sumecta turned again to Mr. Wiskey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is Mr. Sagrado B.’s game with Mr. Kingsborough?”
he asked in Spanish. “Besides the bit of
skirt in the case, what is he out for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve seen the bit of skirt?” Mr. Wiskey asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. She’s it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what he is out for: just the woman in the
case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s getting to be too old for that kind of game,”
Sumecta objected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s got a bit of needle against this one and so she’s
got to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was the needle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something that touched him where he lives. But
Mr. B. has a long arm and a way of getting his own back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she’s to be Mrs. Sagrado B.,” Sumecta said in
English. “And what is Mr. K. to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s going to be beef-stoo,” Mr. Wiskey said in the
same tongue. “And if he don’t like being in the soup, he
can go in the cold-meat cart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder at Mr. B. starting this,” Sumecta said, “just
at this time, when the other thing is getting ready. This
woman business will make a stir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally, and while the stir is on, we’ll be visiting
friends in Santa Barb. But here comes Ben. Viva Ben!</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We want only Ben,</p>
<p class='line0'>Ben, Ben and white men.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The white men present joined in the cry of “Long live the
Christian.” Captain Cary, edging back to his seat with
his cigar, was doubtful for a moment if they meant him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ben, the hope both of his colour and his creed, came
slouching into the ring with his back turned to the coloured
men’s seats. He was a pale, very evil-looking man, with
oblique eyes that were downcast: nothing short of an
execution would have brought a smile on his mouth. He
slipped off his shabby clothes and appeared in boxing tights.
With his clothes on, he looked mean, but when stripped
to fight, he looked dangerous. His arms and shoulders
were knotted with muscles: he had a fine chest and magnificent
pectoral muscles. When he had been gloved, he
stood up to shake himself down: a more villainous looking
ruffian never entered a ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will Ben be at Mr. K.’s party?” Sumecta asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will stir the beef-stoo,” Mr. Wiskey said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Cary took his seat beside Sard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are just in time, sir,” Sard said. “What do you
think of the Christian champion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s like a man I saw hanged once at Hong Kong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s got a fine chest, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s well ribbed up, but what’s inside? If we have to
meet at night, may it be moonlight and may I be first.
I shall speak to my agents for giving me tickets for such a
place. Now that I am here, I will stay, but I count it
a degrading exhibition.” He settled himself into his seat,
sucked his cigar and stared at Ben.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The very twin-brother of the half-caste I saw hanged,”
he growled. “He was one of those women-killers that go
about cutting women up.” He stared again, with dislike
of the entertainment mixed with determination to see it
through, now that he was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure,” he added, “that he did not cut up the
women and sell them as dogs’-meat. If he did, it was sheer
cannibalism, since they eat dogs there, in some of the quarters.
Seven women, altogether, he cut up.” He lapsed
into silence, gazing over Ben’s head into that other scene
in his memory of the long past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard turned his attention to the two men in front of him,
hoping for more information from them, but Mr. Wiskey
was now deep in his pomegranate and Sumecta was smoking
a cigarillo. Sard pieced together in his mind all that they
had said. “After this fight, which you have arranged,
so that the Carib shall lose, you two, with the help of a
Mr. Abner, and of Ben Hordano, are going to a party to
lay out a Mr. Kingsborough, and abduct a woman, presumably
Mr. Kingsborough’s wife, for the benefit of a Mr. B.
Who is Mr. B.? He is apparently in late middle age,
and vindictive. He must be a dangerous criminal, since
he has planned this abduction. He must be powerful,
because here he is controlling at least four men to do something
dangerous while he leaves the country. He must be
wealthy or he could not control the men or leave the country.
Where is he going, when he leaves the country? They
mentioned ‘being safe in Santa Barb’: no doubt they will
all go to Santa Barbara; to some part or port of it. There
is room enough for them to hide, on that wild coast. At
the same time, this is Mr. B.’s self-indulgence, not his real
occupation, that is preparing something else, more important.
‘The other thing is getting ready.’ I wonder what
thing. Before they mentioned ‘the other thing’ I should
have said that they were all liquor-smugglers, but it sounds
now more like politics of some sort: a revolution here,
perhaps. And yet, these men are all criminals; they
must be in law-breaking of some kind: liquor smuggling
is likeliest. They bring the rum to leeward, land it
somewhere here, carry it across Las Palomas province,
over the frontier into Entre las Montanas, where they sell
it, at three hundred per cent profit, among the gold-miners.
Mr. Kingsborough has the cards stacked against him:
I wonder what I can do to help him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was wondering, he turned leisurely round, first
to his right, as a blind, then to his left, to see who was sitting
in the back row about seven from the end. There were
three or four people close together at that point: a young
well-dressed native, with much silver in his hat; a sad-faced,
thoughtful, middle-aged man, with a goatee beard:
neither of those could be “old Abner.” Next to the middle-aged
man was a man with a pale, predatory, grim face,
having pale eyes, bony cheeks, a beak nose and a slit of a
mouth: he seemed likelier. Next to him was a rosy-faced
old man, white-haired and bearded, jovial and bright-eyed
with good living, like the pictures of Father Christmas:
could that be old Abner? The grim man seemed likeliest
of the four.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bueno; mucho bueno,” Mr. Wiskey shouted to the
referee, who now came into the ring to examine the boxer’s
gloves. “You’re only one hour and thirty minutes late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master of the Ceremonies now followed the referee
into the ring. He wore an evening suit, with a white
waistcoat. A large silver disc hung on his chest from a
broad red ribbon that went about his collar. He carried
a white wand with a cross at its end, like a billiard cue
rest. His hair was plastered down into his eyes with
grease: he had the look of a retired cut-throat who was
also a retired dancing-master: he looked graceful, cruel
and fatigued. He explained that the moment was now
come when the two great champions would display the
splendour of the ancient athletic. The delay, he said,
the deeply regretted delay in beginning, could only be
described as an insult to such an audience: the people
responsible for the delay had been discharged, so that
it would never happen again. Now that all was ready,
he would introduce the referee, Don Isidor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Isidor, a short, thickset, bull-necked, bullet-headed
man, with a bronze-coloured face, scarred from chin to
brow with a horn-rip, advanced into the ring with a set
stage smile, amid thunders of applause. He had been
a matador of renown in his day, but had been “unlucky
with a bull” and had come down to this. He had something
of a style and a tradition about him; a rose
in his ear, the walk and swagger of a tenor, and the contest
look of a bull entering a ring, looking for a fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, gentlemen,” the Master of the Ceremonies
said, “let me introduce to you the famous El Chico, of
the Tierra Firme, and the noble Ben Hordano, of Mexico
City, on my left, on my right; now, as I turn, on my
right, on my left; champions both; noble exponents
of the ancient athletic; gentlemen both, sportsmen both,
and, let me add, gentlemen, quite ready both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed, amid cheers, and stalked out of the ring:
a bell gave a broken tinkle and all four seconds hopped
out of the ring: the boxers stiffened, looked at each other,
the gong banged for time, the men rose, their backless
chairs were whisked away by the legs behind them, and
the fight began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ben came out of his corner looking downwards out
of the corners of both eyes. It was difficult for anyone
to say what he was looking at or whether he saw what
he looked at. He came out with a crouching shuffle, pale,
very silent and very evil. He crossed his opponent, led
without style, squared up to him and sparred for an opening.
The Carib was a very different kind of fighter. Sard
saw at once that El Chico was not only a superb boxer,
but the master of Ben Hordano in every way. He smiled
and shifted and was sleek with a body of a golden bronze.
He played light and landed and got away, then came again,
smiling, muttering little mocks in Spanish, and tapped
Ben in the face, then warmed to his task and put in some
hot ones. Ben came into a clinch, hit the Carib low in
the clinch, hit him low again, hit him in the breakaway,
grappled with him again and again hit him low. The
negroes rose from their seats yelling “Foul!” The Carib
grinned, shook Ben from him, punched him hard on both
sides of the head, rushed him: they grappled again: he
bored Ben to the ropes, they sidled along the ropes, putting
in short-arm blows, Ben hitting low continually.
When they broke, they paused and feinted, then rushed
into a clinch: the Carib had the better of it; Ben came
out of it uncertain. The Carib rushed and landed; Ben
countered wildly, the Carib drew blood and shook him
and followed him up. All the negroes rose again and
cheered and cheered and cheered. Ben went into a clinch
and hit low and hung on: the gong put an end to the
round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of that?” Captain Cary asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hordano ought to be pitched out of the ring, sir, and
the referee with him. I’ve never seen fouler fighting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Others thought the same, for at least a hundred negroes
surged down to the ringside yelling “Foul! Foul!” Half-a-dozen
of the bloods, in sailor suits, clambered up by
the ropes to insult the referee, with dirty words ending
in ucho and uelo. The referee seemed not to regard
them for a moment: he stalked up and down, looking
over their heads. Someone flung a bottle at him as he
stalked, it hit him on the side of the head and knocked
the rose out of his ear. He changed on the instant to a
screaming madman; he picked up the bottle by the neck
and beat the bloods off the ropes with it, and then yelled
at them in a sort of frenzy of blasphemy till they went
back to their seats. He stood glaring down at them
till they were quiet, then, with a gesture he resumed his
dignity, and told them that as the referee he would stop
the bout if they did not behave more like caballeros. “I
am the referee and I am Isidor, and no man shall dictate
to me nor daunt me. Never had I thought that my fellow-citizens
of Las Palomas would try to impose the mob-will
upon the individual. On this individual they fail,
for I am Isidor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off his remarks in order to walk across to
Ben, to caution him for hitting low: in doing this, it occurred
to him that he might seem less partial if he cautioned
the Carib, so he walked over and cautioned El Chico
also. The time between the rounds had lengthened out
to some three minutes with all this, so that Ben was fresh
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” Don Isidor said, “all is quiet, is it not so? This
is Las Palomas, I hope, not Europe with her savagery.
It is thus that we deport ourselves, with calm, with the
individual, with Isidor.” He gave a grand gesture to
the time-keeper; the gong clanged: the second round
began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gong had scarcely stopped before Ben was in the
Carib’s corner on a roving cruise. Like many men, he
boxed better for having had his stage fright warmed out of
him in the knock and hurry of a first round. He hit rather
low still; perhaps with his oblique and downcast eyes he
could not do otherwise. He was clumsy but exceedingly
strong. The Carib fought him off and made some play upon
his face, but lightly as though the bout were a sparring
match. Ben’s seconds shouted insults at him; the negroes
yelled to him to go in and finish the dirty white dog. He
boxed on gracefully, grinning alike at insults and cheers:
he was playing with Ben. He drove Ben into a corner
and clouted him right and left, Ben kneed him hard in the
ribs and drove himself out of the corner; turning sharply,
he fouled the Carib with both hands, kneed him in the ribs
again and sent his right across as the Carib staggered. He
was short with his blow; the Carib slipped aside, recovered,
rushed and sent Ben flying through the ropes, off the platform,
into his seconds’ arms. The negroes rose and yelled
and sang; knives and revolvers came out on to the laps
of the whites. The referee counted five very slowly while
Ben climbed back into the ring. The Carib rushed: Ben
stopped him: got into a clinch with him: refused to break:
hung on to him: wore through the round with him hanging
on his shoulder, while the negroes sank back into their seats
with a moaning croon. Right at the end of the round the
men broke: the Carib came in like a flash, Ben rallied to
it, there was a hot exchange: then—Time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly there came yells of protest at the foulness of
Ben’s fighting, but the yells this time were from a few,
because all saw that it had been the Carib’s round. The
referee let the protests pass by, turning his back on the
negroes and talking about something else in a loud tone
on the other side of the ring. He abused a sweetmeat seller
for bringing flies into the arena; when he had finished
with him he swaggered to the centre of the ring with a
phrase:—“It is well known that I am for the sport, the
sport English, the sport native, the sport antique, the sport
all the time. I am not for the white, I am not for the
coloured, I am for the sport: it is well known. Money
speaks all languages, is it not so? The coloured man’s
money is as good as the white’s; is it not so? Good, then;
money speaks all languages, and I am for all money and all
sport.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, because he was well known, was received with loud
applause by the negroes. He ended by calling for some
lemonade, sipping it, and making a joke about there being
no little bit of good in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we need stay for no more, Mr. Harker,” Captain
Cary said. “The white man cannot win, and I do not
think it decent to watch the Carib overcome him. Shall
we go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, sir, if you wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had risen from their seats and had reached the
entrance alley close to their seats, when the gong struck
and the two men rose for the third round. Both sailors
paused where they stood to watch the start of the round.
The fighters were now both warmed to their work, they
went for each other hot and hot. Ben came out of an
exchange with a bloody lip and looking wild; he clinched,
hit in the clinch, was told to break, broke, but clinched
again immediately. They wrestled round the ring together,
then broke, with the look of strain at their nostrils and
blood-smears on their ribs. The Carib feinted, then rushed,
Ben ducked, and, as Sard saw, trod with all his weight on
the Carib’s foot, the Carib tripped, then hit him as he fell, hit
him again and fell over him. Ben got up and stood away,
but the Carib lay still and was counted out. Sard saw
him smile as he lay there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard saw that Mr. Wiskey and Sumecta were standing at
his elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what Mr. K. will get to-night,” Sumecta said in
Spanish; “the right across.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or the cross all right,” Mr. Wiskey said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come then, Mr. Harker?” Captain Cary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned swiftly up the alley out of the arena, while
Don Isidor held up his hand for silence. A roar of riot broke
out behind them an instant later, when Ben was declared
the winner. Sard, glancing back at the door, saw a mob
of negroes at the ropes, and bottles, flasks, oranges, tortillas,
pieces of water melon and bananas falling in the ring round
Don Isidor, who was slipping out of the ring into a phalanx
of whites already formed to receive him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the fresh air, outside the Circo, Captain Cary hailed a
caleche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re well out of that,” he said. “I understood that
it would be a display of athletics, but it was a very low
piece of blackguardism: I call it degrading.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” Sard said, as they settled into their caleche, “you
perhaps noticed the two men in front of us. They were
talking in Spanish of raiding a Mr. Kingsborough to-night,
with a gang, in order to kidnap a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kingsborough? I do not know the name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must be English or American, with that name, sir:
and they talked as if they meant to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kingsborough? I suppose they were these liquor-smugglers,
going to punish one of their gang?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir: they called him <span class='it'>Mr.</span> Kingsborough, as though
he were outside their gang. I wondered, sir, if you would
mind enquiring at the Club, where Mr. Kingsborough lives,
so that we could give him a warning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know that I want to be mixed up in the business,
Mr. Harker. But you say they mean to kidnap a woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t a very easy thing to do, in a fine modern town
like Las Palomas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They talked as though it would be easy to them, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fail to see how it can be easy, Mr. Harker. I should
not like to have to try it, even with all hands. However,
what is the time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty minutes to five, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The tug will be alongside in an hour, and we aren’t
hove short yet. What’s more: I don’t like the look of that
sky at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, we ought to do what we can. We will just ask
at the Club, if this person should be known. But it would
be wiser, I should have thought, to go direct to the police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, if these people are liquor-smugglers, the chances
are that they have bribed the police, or have an arrangement
with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is so. There was a man at the Club the other
night who said openly that when he settled here, he asked
how he could stock his cellar. They told him that it would
be costly, as liquor is against the law, but that he could
stock his cellar if he put his order through the chief of
police. So he did, and the stuff was delivered. But that
was last year, Mr. Harker. They have put in a new Chief
of Police since; this Colonel Mackenzie, a Scotch-American:
there is no such thing as squaring him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, we shall pass the Club on our way to the Palace of
Justice. Might we pass word at both?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is so. Heave round, then, Mr. Harker. Just
pass the word to the driver. But kidnapping a woman,
Mr. Harker .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t believe that it could ever be done.
I’ve never heard of it’s being done. What would be the
object?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Partly the woman, sir, and partly (as far as I could
gather) to pay off some old score.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, a man would have to be a pretty thorough-paced
scoundrel even to plan a thing like that; but the doing of
it is what I don’t see. How would it be done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, they said that Ben Hordano would be there, so I
suppose they mean to knock her senseless: give her the
knock-out blow on the chin and then lash her up, like a
hammock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Mr. Harker; men are not like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, Ben Hordano is not a man, but a dangerous animal.
The others are the same: they neither think nor act like
men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but, Mr. Harker, a woman is not so easy to attack
as a man. You ask one of these big policemen: they would
rather tackle three men than one woman. I’ve known it
take seven policemen to take one woman to prison: she
was a little woman, too; but she kept them guessing and
one of them was streaming with blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that in England, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, in London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are very forbearing men, sir, the London police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They know when they meet their match, Mr. Harker;
but here we are at the stairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>Otoque</span> is in, sir; we have a fair chance of our
mail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing much coming to me, that I’ve any
reason to look forward to. The post is like hope, Mr.
Harker, best in youth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is Mr. Brentano, from the agents, sir. He has
some letters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, sir, to port, talking to a priest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait one minute, Mr. Harker, he may have some news
for us. Ho, Mr. Brentano, were you waiting here to intercept
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentano left the priest and came running up to
Captain Cary, who had now dismounted from the caleche.
Mr. Brentano was a middle-aged, foxy-looking man with
an astute mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Captain Cary,” he said, “the boatmen told me
that you had not gone aboard. I hoped to catch you here
as you went off. By the way, here is some mail for the
<span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>. There is this priest, a Father Garsinton, from
the mining district, who came in, just as the office closed,
to beg a passage to Santa Barbara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has a letter from one of our clients, one of our most
important clients.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I understand that he wants to come in the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well; he comes from one of our very best clients,
Captain Cary, so if you could manage to strain a point.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He is a priest, used to every kind of hardship; you could
put him in the coal-hole, anywhere, it would make no
difference to him, he would give no trouble. I don’t
suppose he’s very rich, but of course he would pay his
passage. You see, Captain Cary, it is a very special case.
He is a poor man. He has only a month’s leave of absence.
He wants to reach Santa Barbara to settle the affairs of
his mother, who has died there. He has missed the
<span class='it'>Alvarado</span>. He is an Englishman and his poor sister is in
Santa Barbara all alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Cary bit his glove, and showed a poor mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose we’ll have to take him,” he growled to Sard;
“I hate priests: they always take snuff. But I’ll have no
nonsense about fish on Fridays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentano led up and introduced Father Garsinton.
Sard noticed the priest particularly. He was a big bull of
a man, with immense chest and shoulders, a short, thick
neck, a compact, forceful head and little glittering eyes.
There was something magnificent in his bearing. He was of
about the middle age, near that time in life when muscle
goes to flesh, but still on the sinewy side of it. At a first
glance, his face, which was fresh-coloured, looked wholesome,
hearty and healthy; but at a second glance Sard felt
that there was something wanting. There was a greyish
puffiness under the eyes, and something unnatural, or at
least unusual, about the eyes themselves. The man’s face
was unusual, the man was unusual, he was an odd-looking
man, with enormous bodily strength to make his oddness
felt. Sard, who had not seen any such Englishman before,
realised that a man so odd would choose a way of life
followed by few Englishmen. Father Garsinton wore new
blacks; he was smart, for a priest from a mining camp;
his cloth smelt new; his voice, as he thanked Captain Cary,
was soft and gracious, but his eye was sidelong as he spoke,
taking stock of Sard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Harker,” Captain Cary said, “will you be away,
then to make those enquiries, and then follow us on
board?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you should hear of those people, don’t let them
entangle you into delaying. There’s a norther coming and
I cannot wait for you. I would not like you to lose your
passage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not lose my passage, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see the tug’s down the quay there, with steam up.
Now, Mr. Garsinton, have you any gear to go aboard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Captain Cary, a small trunk and that packing-case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That packing-case? That sort of deckhouse by the
bollard? It looks like a pantechnicon van. What is in it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two sets of Las Palomas crockery for my sister, with
the necessary packing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to pay me freight on it. It will take a
yard-tackle to get it over the side. Now we must get a
boatman and a couple of Carib boys to get it aboard for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard in his caleche was by this time turning about to go
to the hotel. He paid particular attention to the packing-case,
which shone there in new white wood beside the
bollard. He thought that it looked big for two sets of
crockery, but supposed that the stuff was dunnaged
against the sea. He drove to the hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the hotel, the woman in charge remembered the
name of Kingsborough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, “a lady and her brother, rather
more than three weeks ago; they were here for two
nights, on the first floor, in Rooms B and D. Let me
see. February the 20th and 21st, it was. They came in
on the <span class='it'>Palenque</span> from San Agostino. They were going to
stop somewhere here, he said. He came in for letters a
day or two after they left the hotel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard thanked her, turned to the 20th February and saw
the names:</p>

</table>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'>written by the man in what is called a Civil Service hand.
“Here they are,” he said. “Do you happen to know
where they went when they left?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman turned up a register. “No,” she said.
“They breakfasted here on the 22nd, and then left the
hotel. I’m not here in the mornings, but he said they were
going to stop here for a little. They were taking a furnished
flat, the upstairs maid thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you happen to know what he is doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Writing something for some examination, so someone
said. He was a very young gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was she like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very nice lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could your colleague, who saw them go, tell me where
they went, when they left here? I want to give them a
message.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other clerk won’t be here till midnight,” the
woman said. “Perhaps you could come back, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drove on to the Club, much pleased to be on the track
of these Kingsboroughs. There was something odd about
the names of Hilary and Margarita. “ ‘A very young
gentleman,’ ” he repeated, “and ‘a very nice lady.’ And
there, as it happens, is their enemy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, on the pavement before a café on the water-front,
was Mr. Wiskey dancing a Hottentot breakdown to
his friends. Mr. Wiskey’s hands were behind his back,
jutting out his coat-tails; his head was bowed forward
because of his boil; he was singing as he danced:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“O, I’m a lady,</p>
<p class='line0'>A Hottentot lady,</p>
<p class='line0'>A one-time-piecee lubly gal O.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>His friends kept time for him as he danced by clacking
spoons on their front teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard wondered how it had come about that a very nice
lady and a very young gentleman had roused the employer
of such a crew to take extreme measures against them.
He reckoned that it would be quite impossible for him to
find these Kingsboroughs and then visit Los Xicales.
“The thing has always mocked me,” he said, “perhaps
all things do, if you think too much of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He entered the Club just as the clocks struck five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, for the love of Mike,” the Club porter said, “if
it ain’t Mr. Harker! Why, sir, how are you? Maybe
you’ll not remember me, but I was in the crowd with you
in the <span class='it'>Venturer</span> one trip, ’way back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard saw before him a young man of about twenty-five
with a smile which brought him back to memory. It was
Richard Shullocker, a young American who had been
stranded as a lad by the death of his parents during an
epidemic in one of the fever ports. He had shipped
himself aboard the <span class='it'>Venturer</span> as an ordinary seaman, so as
to reach a windward port from which he could sail for
Boston. In spite of his age, he had done very well. He
had been known on board as the Big Smiled Kid, for his
smile stretched from ear to ear and never ceased in any
trouble or any weather. Now here he was, prosperous and
ambitious, a Club porter in Las Palomas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Richard Shullocker,” Sard said. “So you are
here. I’ve often wondered what became of you. You’re
looking well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. This place suits me. But I’m through here
this month. I’ve figured out this hotel and club business.
I’m going to start business in New York City on my own
account. And I suppose you are Captain Harker now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, just mate; with Captain Cary still. And now I
want you to help me. Do you know of any man in this
Club, a courtesy member probably, of the name of Kingsborough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sure, Mr. Harker. A young fellow, Mr. Hilary
Kingsborough. If that’s the man, he was in here for his
mail only half an hour ago. He’s been here about three
weeks. He’s staying at a place up the coast, General
Martinez’ place, Los Xicales.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Los Xicales,” Sard said, startled. “That house near
the beach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Colonel Mackenzie hired it for him; the police
colonel. He’s staying there with his sister, who is sure
one lovely woman; but they’re going from here to-morrow,
down to Ytá-Ytá.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do they come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England, I guess. He writes up these old Spanish
buildings and his sister draws them. She’s just plum
lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to get out to them, to give them a warning. I
believe that they’re threatened by a gang of rough-necks.
I’m sailing at six and have very little time. While I go
out to them (I know the way to Los Xicales), will you go to
the Palace of Justice and ask Colonel Mackenzie to have a
patrol along there to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, Mr. Harker, I’ll go right now. But how are you
going to Los Xicales? Not in that shay, I guess, if you’re
in any hurry. You’d best take my bicycle if you’re
hurrying. Say, George, rouse up the bicycle for Mr.
Harker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the negro went into the basement for the bicycle,
Sard said that the crowd on Las Palomas beach seemed
tougher than formerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is so,” Richard said. “These rum-runners have
made it a tough joint. They run rum in and they run
guns out. That mush-nosed maggot, Don José, is doing
it all, to rouse up trouble in Santa Barbara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don José, that scum, against the Dictator?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ain’t called a scum here in Las Palomas, Mr.
Harker. This rum-running has made him a very rich man
and his stock is away up in G. You’ll find that Don José
will have another try for Santa Barbara before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m bound for Santa Barbara,” Sard said. “Would
Mr. Kingsborough be mixed up with, or against, the Don
José gang?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess not,” Richard said. “One can’t ever tell.
He wouldn’t be <span class='it'>with</span> him, that’s sure: Mr. Kingsborough’s
a gentleman. But here’s your bicycle, and if you’re sailing
at six, I guess you’ll have to roll your tail like the Arab or
you’ll not make it. Don’t you heed your caleche, I’ll
square your driver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One other thing,” Sard said. “Do you know a priest,
a Father Garsinton? A lone rogue bull of a man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir: he don’t come bullin’ around here any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, thank you for your help,” Sard said. He swung
the bicycle round and rode off, thinking that he would have
to sprint to be on board by six.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” he thought, “I lied. The dreams are true. Here
I am, led to this house, and by what strange ways. She
will be there then, stopping with the Kingsboroughs.
Could she be this Miss Kingsborough? But that cannot
be, of course; Juanita de la Torre cannot well become
Margarita Kingsborough. But let that wait. The dreams
are true. She will be there somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rode through the market-place over a mess of corn-sheath
and trodden pumpkin, and away through the North
gate to the savannah. Outside the walls there were a few
houses, then a few market gardens, then the rolling sage-green
savannah to the forest. The road was not macadam
but dirt-track, with soft going, after the first mile. The
houses ceased with the macadam, then came nothing but a
ruined hut or two, and from time to time a stone cross, with
a tin mug of holy water, a bunch of tinsel flowers, and an
inscription, begging all who passed to pray for the soul of
such an one, who had been killed there. Most of these
many dead had been killed by Indians in the three dreadful
raids of Capa Roja, when Sard had been a little child.
Seven stone crosses together marked where Capa Roja
had with his own hands martyred “seven most Christian
virgins” as recently as 1872. Indian trouble had not
ceased there until 1876.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing these, Sard rode on up a rise into the wild,
mainly upon grass. Las Palomas had shrunk away from
this northern tract, perhaps because of these old Indian
killings; the savannah was as it had been before the white
man had landed, an expanse of grass which seemed always
alive from the wind. On a rise, the forest hove in sight,
stretching across Sard’s track from the sea to the mountains.
Clumps of forest stood out in the savannah like
bull-bisons in advance of the herd: the sun was in their
tops in a way which told Sard that he had not a moment to
lose. “Still,” he said to himself, “I am going to Los
Xicales, to her. Time will not matter beyond a certain
point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the forest a peon in a scarlet serape came loping
on a pinto pony. He came with a jingle of plate, for horse,
man and trappings were hung with discs and dangles
beaten out of broad silver Mexican dollars. He rode, like
a part of his horse, with matchless grace and swagger. He
had a xicale flower in his hat, which he wore sideways, so
as not to crush the yellow cigarettes behind one of his ears.
He was probably an estancia peon, but he had the manners
of a Master of the Horse to a Queen. “Xicales,” Sard
thought, “you have come from there. Con Dios, caballero.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peon gravely saluted as he loped by, thinking that
without doubt the English were mad, but that without
doubt such was God’s will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost immediately after the xicale flower had passed,
the track, which had been trending inland (for the advantage
of the rise in the Indian time) swerved seaward
sharply, so that Sard as he rode had a glimpse of the
sailing ship anchorage, and a part of Jib and Foresail Quay
where the tug still lay at her berth. “There, Sard Harker,”
he said to himself, “that has been your art hitherto and
now you are a master of it. How much longer are you
going to use your life in box-hauling another man’s yards
around? Not long after you find ‘her,’ I know, and
perhaps you will find ‘her’ this hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The forest glowed in its tops across his path: myriads
of its birds came in to roost. “I shall have to sprint all I
know,” Sard thought, “if I am to reach Los Xicales and
be back on board before we sail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind him, from out in the anchorage, but very clear
in the quiet of the evening, came a cheer, followed by the
chorus of men singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There it is,” he said; “they are heaving in already.
It must be half-past five already. I must set my stunsails
or be done for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glow became intenser upon the trees as he drew
nearer to them, then, quite suddenly, he shot out of the
glow into the gloom of the forest, which struck cold as
well as gloom. On his left were pine trees all sighing
together, on his right were Turkey oaks all hoary and evil
with Spanish moss. They looked like evil Mr. Wiskeys
grown bigger. They seemed to thrust out their heads
and to wag their beards and to be wicked to the core.
Through the crowds of these trees, Sard followed the track,
in sound of the beating of the sea, till he dismounted at the
lodge beside the gates. Wired to the side of the lodge was a
white wooden roofing shingle marked in pale blue letters
with the words “Los Xicales.” It had a look of having
no one there, of being to let. As Sard looked at it, he felt
an oppression in the air, as though all the life had gone out
of it. “Here’s the norther,” he said; “and as it is
coming on so slowly, it is going to be bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard propped his bicycle against the gates and hammered
on the lodge-door with his knife-handle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody answered. The door, which stood slightly ajar,
let out a smell of stale tortilla. Sard could see little pale
ants wandering on the floor within. He hammered again
and again and called. Presently a slatternly-young negress,
in a blue cotton gown patched with sacking, came up
among the pine trees, and grinned at Sard like an idiot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Jesu,” she said, “O Jesu!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I go to the house? Is anybody there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The gates are always locked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I want to go to the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tehee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I go to the house, to see Mr. Kingsborough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Jesu.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to the house. See that no one steals
this bicycle, or you’ll be a sick negress, mucha,
mucha.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crossed the fence by the gap (the fence was indeed
mainly gap) and set off down the weed-blinded drive under
pines which had been tapped and were now either dead or
dying. The effect was dismal in that muggy air, but
Sard’s heart beat high with the expectation of adventure.
Beyond all doubt, this was the house of his dream, the
dreams were true, and he was going to meet her the very
thought of whom made all that inner life of which no one
had any suspicion. The turn in the drive brought him
within sight of the house. He stood still, at the turning,
to take stock of it. Then he went boldly up the steps and
rang the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old white-haired negro, with charming manners,
admitted and announced him. In a moment he returned,
to say that Mr. Kingsborough would see him, at once, if
he would follow. Sard followed, along the hall, which was
paved, for the coolness, and grass-matted for ease in walking.
The hall was bare of furniture save for an old Spanish
chest, painted with the life of St. Dominic, which stood
under a window, with its legs in glass jars (against the
ants). Like all men accustomed to take bearings, Sard
fixed the details of it. It was a long hall running along
the length of the house, with doors opening off it, and a
staircase at the western end. The old negro major-domo
opened a door a few paces from this staircase, and
announced him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Señor Don Harker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard went in and instinctively put back a hand to close
the door. He felt the door as the negro closed it; he was
amazed at its weight: it was black maruca wood from the
house of some conquistador.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room to which he entered was a long room at the
southern corner of the house. The wall to his right, as he
entered, contained a French window opening upon the
verandah. A woman stood at the door of the French
window, half in the verandah. He could not see her face,
since it was turned from him, but there was something
about her that made his heart stand still. She spoke as
he closed the door:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will water the xicales, Hilary,” she said, “and come
back when you are alone.” Her voice rang in his brain
like a memory: she closed the glass door behind her, and
passed by the verandah steps into the garden out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard turned to his left. A young man had risen from a
chair to greet him. Sard looked at him eagerly for some
trait or feature that would be like the face he sought, but
the face was new to him: it was the face of a smiling
young man, fond of fun and ease, perhaps twenty-five
years old. Sard envied him the fun and ease, but felt
that the lad was a child, compared with himself, who had
dealt with the sea for ten years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can I do for you, Mr. Harker?” the young man
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard told what he had heard at the ringside and
described the two men. The young man listened attentively
and showed no sign of fear, but seemed puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know nobody like those two men,” he said; “and
as for anyone called B., or Sagrado B., in Santa Barbara,
I know no one of that name nor in that place. We have
never been near Santa Barbara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor met either the Dictator or Don José?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never. I know nothing of either, except the gossip
that one hears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The danger threatened your sister more than yourself,
Mr. Kingsborough. I gathered from what was said that
this man in Santa Barbara had a grudge against your sister,
perhaps of some years’ standing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that’s out of the question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no other Miss Kingsborough here, or any
Spanish lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spanish lady? No, nor other Miss Kingsborough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They meant your sister, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but that is impossible. Of course, I am very
much obliged to you for coming to warn me. It was very
good of you. Do you think that we are in danger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were a bad two, mixed up with others worse;
and we have a saying, ‘It’s better to be sure than sorry.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well; thanks. Only, I must say that I do not understand
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see, sir,” Sard said, “that you do not take it very
seriously. Well, perhaps it is best not to cross rivers till
you reach the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Threatened men live long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in seaport towns,” Sard answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Hilary said, smiling, “what do you think we
ought to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have passed word to the police to stand by,” Sard
said. “But you know how much that is worth, among
these Occidentales. I would say this, Mr. Kingsborough:
take your sister in to the hotel in town, the Santiago, until
you leave Las Palomas. I understand that that will be
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You really think that the danger is as great as that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know the danger,” Sard said, “only the risk.
That is what I should do, if it were myself and a sister of
mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Harker. Will you smoke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, I don’t smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you drink something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you said, Mr. Harker, that you belonged to a
ship here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>, sailing now for Santa Barbara.
And I must go aboard now or lose my passage. So I will
say good-bye, Mr. Kingsborough. I hope to hear some
day that nothing has come of all this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your ship a steamer, did you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ship in the sailing ship berths there, about to
sail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, a pleasant voyage to you. And thank you again
for coming to warn me. I’ll see you to the gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside, the sun had westered so that the light was off
the house. The oppression in the air, added to the gloom
of the evening, made the place menacing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the angle of the house, the woman was watering the
xicales. She wore white gardening gauntlets and a sun
hat. Sard felt his heart leap up with expectation. He
took a step towards her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way, Mr. Harker,” Hilary said, correcting him.
“That way leads to the garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman had turned from them; he did not see her
face; she disappeared round the angle of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me,” Sard said. “But is there no Spanish
lady here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spanish lady?” Hilary asked. “You asked me that
before. No. You may mean Tia Eusebia: she’s
coloured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll speak to your sister about this warning,” Sard
said. “And tell her everything that I have told you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary answered coldly that naturally he would. The
thought came to Sard with the pain of a blow that the
dreams were all lies, and that once again he had failed to
find her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anything the matter, Mr. Harker?” Hilary asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little queer,” Sard said. “Don’t come any further.
I’ll let myself out. I must hurry. But tell me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Are you Spanish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Hilary answered, looking at him oddly, “I’m
English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, then. Good-bye. And I hope all will go well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye and thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard hurried away, trying to pull himself together. He
knew that Hilary thought him mad or drunk. Hilary
watched him as far as the gates: then waved a hand and
turned back to the house. “Odd beggar,” Hilary thought,
“a very odd beggar. I didn’t half like the looks of him.
He seemed to me to be as mad as a hatter. And asking
me if I am Spanish. And whether I kept a Spanish lady!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the gates Sard stopped, saying to himself that he
must go back and warn the woman. “That boy does not
believe,” he said; “he thinks me daft; and she is in
danger. And beside all that, I must speak to her. I
must ask her if she be that one; for I believe she is: I
believe she must be. And yet she cannot be Juanita: the
name and everything else is changed. Her brother thought
me mad when I asked if he were Spanish. Yet she was
like enough to her: and then there was my dream.
Changed or not, I must know, one way or the other; and
besides, she must be warned. She is older and wiser than
this boy and she must be warned of the danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew very well that if he went back, he would meet
a Hilary convinced of his madness and not speak to Miss
Kingsborough, yet he half turned. As he did so there
came from the anchorage far behind him, yet very clearly,
a beating of the <span class='it'>Pathfinder’s</span> bells as though for a fire. In
an instant’s hush after the stopping of the bells there was
a shout, which he heard but could not distinguish, followed
by three roaring cheers. He knew what it was. The
<span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>, being about to sail, was cheering all the ships
in port. The cheering was followed by a carillon of bells
and a thunder of cheering as both anchorages made
reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There it is,” Sard muttered, “I have twenty minutes
before they man the windlass. I’m due on the fo’c’sle-head
to see the anchor grow. I’ll do it yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He might have done it, no doubt, but when he reached
the iron gates, his bicycle was gone.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2>PART TWO</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>ilary Kingsborough</span> returned to his sitting-room
to think over what Sard had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t half like that fellow’s looks,” he
muttered. “If there are thieves about, he might well be
their advance agent come to spy out the land. Besides,
kidnapping ladies is simply not done. What rot! It
isn’t easy to hide a dead body, but as for a living one,
it’s out of the question. How are they going to get a
living woman out of Las Palomas against her will, either
by land or sea? They can’t do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked to the window to look out at the port. “All
the same,” he said, “old General Martinez may have
heirlooms and things put away here. Burglars might have
got wind of them, perhaps. I’ll lock up carefully to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood at the window, looking out at the glow. The
coast mailboat was at her buoy from San Paulo. She
was the <span class='it'>Otoque</span> that was to take him down the coast on her
return journey the next day. The launches ground and
hove about her gangway, while the slings of crates swayed
up, poised, swung and jolted down among cries and clanking.
There was a run of sea in the harbour which had not
been there that afternoon; launches squatting on to it
under way split it white. A sort of swell seemed to be
coming into the harbour from the north. His thoughts
were of Sard: but he could not help noticing the swell.
“It is all rubbish,” he said. “Someone at the Club has
sent that fellow here for a rag. These things do not
happen. This is one of that bounder Coghill’s rises. He is
always planting rags on people. What an ass that I was
not to see it at once! Now that fellow will be at the Club
telling how he scared me. Then at midnight, I suppose,
they will serenade us with firecrackers and expect us to let
them in and give them cocktails. Well, they will not get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently as he sat reading at his table, he heard the
song of men from the sailing ship anchorage. He went
out into his verandah to listen. It had gone strangely
still and close, he thought; the roar of the chorus came to
him over the water as though it were in the grounds. They
were only heaving in, but he concluded that they were
getting the anchor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That part of it at least is true,” he thought, “she <span class='it'>is</span>
sailing now: and if he were one of her crew, he must very
nearly have lost his passage. Still, those silly devils at
the Club would have chosen him for that reason; because
he will be gone, out of the way, before the rag is apparent.
The whole thing is a rag.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the closeness he heard, quite distinctly, the words of a
song:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The charming little girl down Tiger Bay.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Then the singing stopped and discomfort grew upon him;
it was really very close indeed. At the same time the glow
on the masts in harbour died suddenly: all the colour
became ashen: night seemed to prepare and advance in
the one moment; he noticed the flash of the light on
Point Manola. “How dark it is,” he thought, “the very
instant the sun goes down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shivered on his verandah, not from cold but from
uneasiness; he stayed an instant longer, half thinking
that he saw something stir among the mita shrubs. He
turned his glasses on the spot, but decided that he had been
mistaken: there was nothing there. “Yet it looked like
a face,” he said; “like the face of a little evil elderly man,
such as Mr. Harker described.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that the light was off the day, the place looked
forbidding. He saw, for the first time, how easy it would
be to creep up to the house unobserved, and how hard it
might fare with them if people did creep up, for revenge or
lust. “Of course, it is absurd,” he said to himself, “but
I will walk round the house before we settle in. I will
make sure that that was not a face in the mita shrubs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked up a stick, in case of snakes, and stepped out
into the garden towards the shrubs. The world had
already taken the night like a garment: the bats and
wood-owls were abroad: the frogs in the marsh were singing:
the sparks of fireflies burned and died among the
dusk. He thrust into the shrubbery to the place which
had made him doubt; he beat all round it with his stick.
No one had been there; no one was among the rocks
beyond the shrubs, nor on the beach between the arms of
the rocks. The place was as deserted as it always was at
such a time. The ships’ lights shone out from the anchorage.
He heard some men in a fishing boat a mile away. Nothing
there told of anything but quiet and of day telling
day; no wind, no sea, no tumult: nothing but night at
the end of toil. He could see no footprints on the beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the covert on his way round the house he paused to
listen. He heard nothing but the noises of the anchorage:
a hail, a clanking of something coming to anchor, the hush
and hiss of waves on the beach. Listening intently, he
heard the noise of the lesser world: the snake moving;
the rat roving; the insect’s shrilling. The night seemed
all whispering and stealthy; he did not like it. He was
glad to see his sister’s lit window in the upper floor, with
his sister’s shadow against the blind. “This will not do,”
he told himself. “Very likely that ruffian Coghill is
watching to see me go round the house. That devil
Coghill is always springing his rags: then watching to see
how they take. I will work a rag on him before I leave the
coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had walked through the covert all round the
house, finding nothing suspicious, he looked into the ruins
of the out-houses, where the Martinez’ slaves had lived in
old time. They were plainly given over to the rats and
scorpions; there was nothing suspicious there, except that
in one of the ruins there was a faint smell of tobacco, as
though someone had smoked there during the day. “And
who could have smoked there? Who could have, or
would have? No one living here.” He could see no
cigar-stub, nor cigarette-end, no match, nor sign of smoker;
there was nothing there except the memory or ghost of
tobacco; it was hardly even a smell, hardly a flavour.
By opening his mouth and breathing in, Hilary felt the
record of tobacco against his palate. Then, on the wall,
he saw a faint luminous streak, which at first he thought
to be one of the centipedes which glow with the decay they
live in. Looking at it with a light, he saw a match streak.
Someone had struck a wax match there, probably during
the day, since the phosphorescence still showed. Who
could have been there with a wax-match? No native, no
one employed about the house. “That limits it,” he said,
“to members of the Club, like Coghill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he left the out-houses, he walked along the foot of
the perron to the verandah. All seemed quiet there: the
night was darker, the stars brighter, and the harbour lights
twinkled more, but the sea-breeze was not setting in.
“It is a lovely night,” he said. “All this rag business is
absurd. I will not give it another thought. I will send
Ramón, or one of the boys, down to the police, perhaps,
for Margaret’s sake; but I will see that Coghill is paid for
this. What is that white thing on the shingle there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white thing lay on the ground near the steps leading
to the verandah, in such a position that he must have seen
it, had it been there when he left the house. “It was not
there when I came down,” he said. It was a large, coarse,
dirty-white linen handkerchief with a coloured border.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will be Ramón’s,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went into the house, and called for Ramón, but
received no answer. At his fourth call, his sister answered
over the railings of the floor above: “Ramón has gone
out,” she said. “He went into the garden five minutes
ago, to look for you. Did he not find you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; nor did I hear him. I will call him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went out and called Ramón three times, but received
no answer. “It is very odd,” he said, “he does not reply.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably he has gone to the lodge; and he is a little
deaf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary came within the house to examine the handkerchief
by the lamp in the hall. It was a man’s pocket
handkerchief with a blue border: in one corner the initials
A.B. were roughly stitched with black cotton: the stitching
looked liker a laundry mark than a mark of the owner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Margarita,” he said, “I found this handkerchief in
the gravel outside. It is marked A.B.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be Ramón’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ramón’s would not be marked A.B.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it must be your friend’s: the man who was
here must have dropped it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would not have had a rag like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it’s Lotta’s; she is the woman at the lodge;
feckless enough for any rag.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would she be doing in front of the verandah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dropping her handkerchief. Leave it. She will
come back for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had laid the handkerchief upon the shingle,
he examined the floor of the verandah for footprints,
but found none that he could read. He entered his study
somewhat ill at ease. When he entered, he stood still
for a few seconds listening intently: then he looked under
the table, behind the chair, behind the curtains and into
the outer passage. Finding nothing suspicious, he returned,
locked the window door and drew the curtains across it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the same,” he said, “it is just as well to be on the
safe side. It probably is a rag, but, as that Harker fellow
said, ‘it’s better to be sure than sorry.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sister entered the room behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you looking at, Hilary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the bay,” he answered. “We’re in for a storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It feels close enough for a cyclone,” she answered.
“Who was your friend who was here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No friend of mine. A Mr. Harker, a sailor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had you seen him before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did he come about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute,” he said. “If we are in for a cyclone,
would you not prefer to go into town for the night? This
forest will be a dree place in a gale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be sheltered here,” she said. “I’d rather be
in a forest than in a city during a cyclone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so sure,” he answered. “These pine trees
wail so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked out upon the darkness beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did the sailor man come here for?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sailor? Oh, nothing much. It was some rag
of that bounder Coghill’s, I think. They said he was
planning to get a rise out of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean Mr. Colin Coghill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He went up the coast to San Felipe three days ago.
His brother has just died there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Pennington told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, it was some other fellow’s rag, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did not look to me to be the sort of man concerned
in a rag. You say that his name was Harker? It seemed
to me that I had met him somewhere. His face seemed
familiar. Won’t you tell me what the rag is or was to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Margarita, of course; but it seems so absurd.”
He told her in outline what Sard had said, omitting anything
which might frighten her. He made his tale as light
as possible, but he saw that she became very grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you so solemn, Pearl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking of what you said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think that it is anything but a rag?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do, Hilary. The man who came here this
evening was in earnest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did not see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I did. I saw him in the garden. I noticed him
very particularly, because I thought for a moment that
he was someone else, a Mr. Chisholm. The only thing
which puzzles me is the lack of motive. Why should
burglars come here? There is nothing to steal here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is that which makes me think it is all a rag.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a case in Greece last Christmas of English
people being kidnapped and held to ransom. We might
be the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the swag, in this case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Harker thought that the people were not burglars
nor bandits, but rum-runners from Santa Barbara. He
said that they spoke as if they all knew about us and that
a Mr. B., or Sagrado B., apparently their director, had
a score to settle with me. I cannot think of anyone of
that name or nickname.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sagrado B.? Sagrado? The holy or sacred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It means nothing to you, does it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; it does, Hilary; at least it suggests something.
It came into my mind directly you began to speak of this,
and it explains it. You remember how, when you were
a fresher, I went to Paris for a year? Well, when I was
there, I met a man who tried to make love to me; a horrible
man, who practised magic among other things. He
wanted me to help him in a rite, and when I refused, he
said that he would make me help him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was the rite?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, one of the last infamies. It is unspeakable.
When we were in Cuba last winter, I heard that the negroes
practise it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was this fellow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He called himself the Holy One. His real name
was Hirsch: I don’t know what his nationality was:
he talked all languages. He was evil if ever a man was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a good long time ago. He hasn’t bothered
you since then, has he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but he said then that the hour for that rite came
once in every seven years, and it is now almost seven years
since he made me that offer in Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sagrado does mean the Holy One. Do you suppose
that this Hirsch would cherish a grudge or a desire for
all that time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do. I know he would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sailor fellow advised me to take you into town
to the Santiago, till we sail. Suppose we do that? After
all, it would be wiser. I’ll send Ramón up to Paco’s for
the buggy. We should be in the Santiago by half-past
eight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems like running away. Besides, if we go, we
shall be leaving Ramón and his wife, as well as that lunatic
Lotta, to meet whatever trouble may be coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No trouble threatens them, apparently. But I will
explain it to them: if they wish, they can come with us.
All the same, Ramón is a fighter. He was with General
Martinez, under Juarez, in Maximilian’s time; he will
not be easily moved from here. I’ll go send Ramón to
Paco’s; he must be back from the lodge by this time. I’ll
ring.” He moved over to the mantel and pulled the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” he went on, “if we can’t have the buggy,
we can walk. If I put on a sombrero and you a mantilla,
we should pass for two greasers. We will each take a
revolver, of course, but we aren’t likely to meet any bad
characters before midnight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so sure of that; but I’d rather meet them
than stay here for these others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The roads are safe enough. Colonel Mackenzie told
me that there had been no serious crime for over three
months. Las Palomas is reformed. Of course twenty
years ago people disappeared every night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The quicksand out at Melilla is supposed to hide a
good many. Now we’ll just take our things for the night
and be ready to start. Ramón is a long time answering
that bell. I’ll ring again.” He rang again, then walked
to the window and peered out into the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never told me about Hirsch,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is not a fit topic for conversation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry that our happy stay here should end in
a scare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not scared. I am thinking about the people
who disappeared. Do you think that any of them were
women?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord, no! Don’t be distressed, my dear. They
were these drunken diggers from Palo Seco at the time
of the gold-rush. They were just floating men. Every
nation has thousands of them, who cannot settle down.
They wander off to sea or to drive cattle, and they get
caught in a gold-rush or stuck with a knife in a brawl,
or fall off a train or something. They have a run for
their money. The solid fellow sticks at home and grows
fat and bald and warlike in an office. The floating life
has more dash about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want dash,” she said, “you should give up a
planet and try a comet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ramón might try a little dash. I have rung twice.
He must be in now. I’ll try a third. There; he cannot
say that he didn’t hear that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t hear him in the kitchen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is odd that he should be away at this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And on this night, too, Margarita. I will see what
he is up to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went into the corridor calling “Ramón,” but had
no answer and heard no sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ramón!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went into the kitchen. The light was burning;
the table was covered with the preparations for supper;
grape-fruit, a dish of limes, mint, the long glasses with
the crushing spoons for julep, eggs for an omelette, the
patty-pans for hot bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ramón! Tia Eusebia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one answered, but in the silence the clock ticked
and the cazuela in the earthern pot began to boil over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t they there, Hilary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they left the cazuela on the fire? Tia Eusebia
never did such a thing before. Where can they be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must have gone to the lodge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They would never have left these things like this.
They would never both have gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They might, Margarita, with an urgent call, for a
moment or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What urgent call has there been?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ought to have heard any. Or Ramón would have
told us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must have been gone ten minutes. Sudden
death alone would make Tia leave her cooking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go to the lodge to see what has happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait for one moment, Hilary; they may be upstairs.
Tia may have swooned or Ramón had a stroke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tia! Tia Eusebia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ramón!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went upstairs together, into all the rooms, but the
servants were not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must have been called to the lodge,” Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How? Without our hearing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lotta or one of her children ran to the window instead
of coming to the door. We should not have heard that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. And of course if the call were very urgent, Ramón
would not have stopped to tell us that he was going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put on a mantilla, then, Margarita; we will go together
to the lodge. But before we start, we had better be a little
cautious. Those rum-runners may have enticed them out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so,” his sister said. “Ramón went
out to look for you, while you were in the garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did he want with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did not say. I thought he had something to ask
you about supper. I don’t believe he ever came in again.
I haven’t heard him. I believe that he has been out
ever since; Tia Eusebia went on cooking, but at last
became anxious, and then went out to look for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She would have called.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No she wouldn’t, Hilary. Ramón is rather deaf.
She never calls him: she always goes to him. Old
General Martinez has trained them both to be silent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right, I expect, Pearl,” Hilary said. “Most
mysteries have commonplace explanations. But the
question is, what has happened to poor old Ramón? He
is an old man and may have had a stroke or a fall, and
broken a bone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid that he may have turned down to the
creek to find you and been bitten by one of those
horrible moccasins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord! Well. Let’s get a light and come to look
for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t, Hilary. See. Tia Eusebia has taken the
lantern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we will take those old copies of <span class='it'>La Nacion</span> and
light them up for flares. We’ll go to the lodge first, for
Lotta and her children may be ill or something. You
put on this mantilla and I’ll just get my revolver from
the drawer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swathed her in her mantilla, but was rather a long
time getting the revolver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buck up, Hilary,” she called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute,” he answered; “the catch of this
beastly revolver seems to have jammed, or something.
I can’t get it open, to load it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me have a try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid it’s rusted-in, or something. I ought to
have oiled it when I put it away.” He brought it to her.
She thumbed at the catch, which was fixed tight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give it a bang or two with the tin-opener,” he
said. He gave it a bang or three with the tin-opener,
and then again with Tio Ramón’s hammer, but failed
to release the catch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open, you divil,” he said. He gave it a good clout
with the hammer and cracked the catch across; a piece
of metal fell with a clink upon the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I’ve done it,” he said, “I’ve broken the beastly
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were just a little rough with it, weren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but who would have thought the metal would
have cracked like that? It would have been dangerous
work firing a thing as weak as that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have your pearl-handled pistol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but the worst of it is, I’m afraid it won’t take
these cartridges. I meant to have bought some for it only
this afternoon, but like an ass I forgot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we haven’t any firearms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None that we can fire. We could use them as bluffs.
And there’s a machete here, that Ramón cuts vines with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then. Take that. Now, light up a torch
and let us start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rolled up some copies of <span class='it'>La Nacion</span> as torches and
lit one of them while they examined the outer steps. They
called loudly, “Tia Eusebia! Ho, Tia Eusebia!” but
had no reply. They came down the steps into the drive,
by the light of the flaming newspapers, which Margaret
lit one by one as they proceeded. Small things crossing
their track, scared by the light, reassured them, since their
presence showed that no strangers had passed that way
recently. It was dark night now. The shrubbery through
which they passed glistened like a lot of eyes. The depth
of the wood beyond was so ugsome, that it was a pleasure
to them to turn the curve in the drive and see the light
from the open door of the lodge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary called aloud, “Tia Eusebia!” and “Lotta!”
but no answer came from the lodge or from the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is something not quite right here,” Margaret
said. “Jorge! Marianela! Even the children do not
answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will soon find what is amiss. Hola! Tia Eusebia!
I believe that the lodge is empty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That looks bad for Ramón; but we’ll soon know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They both ran to the lodge, calling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go in,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful, Hilary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, my dear,” he said. “If one of these big black
marimbas has come in, there’ll be somebody dead here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rattled with his machete at the door and then went
into the lodge. The oil lamp was burning on the table
beside a pipkin full of frijoles. The room was empty:
the bunks at the side were empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lotta,” he called. “Marianela! It’s as I thought,
Pearl. There’s nobody here at all. But they’ve not been
long gone; these frijoles in the dish are warm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret peeped in at the door. “Aren’t the children
in their bunks?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but they’ve been in their bunks. These blankets
are warm still, and the bichos are on the hop, too, still,
good Lord!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, where are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very odd; but it can’t be foul play; it is on too
big a scale for that: three adults and two children. Come
to the door and let us both shout together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They shouted and yodelled and clapper-shouted for the
missing five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” Hilary said, “anyone within three hundred
yards must have heard; even a deaf person must have
heard. If they’ve been within hearing, they’ve heard us.
Keep quite still now. We may hear an answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They kept as still as mice on the grass near the gate, but
heard no noise at all except the dropping and rustling
never absent from the forest at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the spring equinox, or near it,” Margaret said.
“Just listen a moment longer, Hilary; I seem to catch a
noise like drums and a guitar, very far away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there is some sort of tom-tom going; it’s in the
forest, to the west, in that clearing called Los Jardinillos.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Hilary, don’t you think it likely that the negroes
have been called to some fiesta of the equinox?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That doesn’t fit it. They would have told us. It’s
more likely that a priest has come with extreme unction, in
need of a guide through the forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. That doesn’t fit it. The man who fetched the
priest would be the guide. And the priests here need no
guide to any of their flock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A revivalist preacher would draw these negroes,”
Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not these Catholics, and certainly not without telling
us,” his sister answered. “It must be one of two things,
Hilary. Either there has been some miraculous appearance
in the wood, which would draw them out to worship,
or these rum-runners have devised something. I begin to
be afraid, Hilary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not afraid,” he said. “Do not you be afraid.
Listen a moment. That tom-tom noise seems louder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They listened, while the thudding resolved itself into
the plodding of a trotting carriage-horse coming from the
direction of the port.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A carriage,” she said. “It may be Paco with his
buggy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s more likely to be Colonel Mackenzie,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They listened, while the jog-trot of the horse drew so
near that they could hear the noise of the wheels behind
him. A carriage lamp shone through the trees. One of
the city caleches came to a standstill before them. The
driver told his fare that this was Los Xicales.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary lit a new copy of <span class='it'>La Nacion</span>, so that he might see
this fare. The man got out of the caleche and came towards
him. He was a sleepy-looking man with a face
seemingly made of wood. He blinked as he spoke. His
speech came from somewhere in the northern midlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is thy name, Kingsboora?” he asked, “and has oor
Mr. ’Arker bin ’ere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Hilary said; “he’s been gone from here an
hour and a half.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dostha know which way ’e went?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oor Captain Cary sent me to find oor Mr. ’Arker.
Tha see, there’s a norther coomin’ on. We’re in the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>,
sailing. We don’t want to wait all night, tha see.
Did ’e go back into the town, choom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He went back to his ship, I think,” Hilary said. “You
must have crossed him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it, tha see,” the man said. “ ’E didna coom
by t’reet way. Look, choom, if ’e coom ’ere again, will
tha tell ’im to coom aboard? Ma neem is Dorney. Now,
lad,” he added to the driver, with pantomime instead
of Spanish, “tak’ me back to Jib and Foresail, will
tha?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The driver turned his caleche and carried Mr. Dorney
away into the darkness. When the wheels were almost
out of hearing, Hilary suddenly remembered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were asses,” he said. “We might have gone into
Las Palomas with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking that,” she said. “But we couldn’t
have gone, not knowing about Ramón. I hope that Mr.
Harker has not met with any trouble on his way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not he,” Hilary said. “He took a short cut and
passed this Mr. Dorney on the road somewhere. Let us
call those negroes again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They called, but had no other answer than the distant
drumming noise, which seemed to be a part of the tenseness
of the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It began with Lotta,” Hilary said. “Her handkerchief
proves that Lotta came for Ramón. Any folly may
have come from Lotta. We have given them a fair chance,
now we will go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; there’s no one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was close, still, tense night, save for the sighing in the
pines and that beating, like a heart-beat, from the distant
drum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along, then, Hilary,” she said. “We will take
Paco’s buggy and go into town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They set out for Paco’s estancia. They were both glad
to be out of the grounds of Los Xicales. When they had
gone about a hundred yards, they stopped and looked at
each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re both thinking the same thing,” Hilary said.
“We can’t leave quite like this, without knowing what has
happened to these people. We had better go round the
estate before we go to Paco’s. Or how would it be if you
went to Paco’s alone, while I went back to the house? Or
wait: I’ll walk with you to Paco’s, get Paco and the buggy
and Paco’s son Enrique, with their guns, and then we’ll all
come back together, search the estate and then go to Las
Palomas. Let’s do that: come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said. “All that will take time. I’m afraid
that Lotta, or one of her children, or her imbecile man, or
poor old Ramón, is in extremis somewhere. And our
losing time may be fatal. I don’t like leaving the estate.
I’m not afraid of desperadoes. If they were about, why
did they not set upon us when we were shouting at the
lodge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wondered that, myself, at the time,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely it shows that they are not here. Besides, it is
full early for desperadoes to be abroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see all that,” he said. “We owe it to Ramón to be
sure about him before we leave. We will turn down here,
along the creek, and so circle back to the house. We shall
have newspapers enough to light us there. But I don’t
think we shall find him on this side of the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We may find him at the house,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he be not there, and if we do not meet him or learn
about him within the next ten minutes, then, Pearl, you
and I will go off to Las Palomas, by Paco’s buggy or on
foot. Is that agreed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; agreed. We shall have really done all that we
can, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we have done a good deal in turning off here
for him; but he is a fine old boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would do more than this for us,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true, he would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned into the path beside the creek. There was
plenty of water in the creek and plenty of snags in the
water. The current was tearing at the snags with a lashing
noise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mentioned a Mr. Chisholm,” Hilary said. “Did
I ever meet your Mr. Chisholm, or was he one of your Paris
friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had stopped at this point to light a new torch
from the stump of an old one. He saw her face blush a
little in the light, and her eyes sparkled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George, Pearl,” he said, “you are a lovely woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About Mr. Chisholm,” she said. “I met him at
Passion Courtenay when I was a girl: long before I went
to Paris. I have never seen him since. I don’t expect
that you ever met him. He came with some people called
Penger or Penga.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I never met him. And this Mr. Harker was like
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a pretty rough customer, if you ask me, that
same Mr. Harker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would be very glad of his help, Hilary, if we were to
be mixed up with the friends of that Paris man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put him out of your mind, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could, Hilary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked on until they came to a cleared space by
the water. A wooden bridge had once spanned the creek
here, but it had been swept away in a wash-out. The
palings of it stuck out, like rib-bones, from an island in
midstream. The water went past in a rush, curved out
into the sands, and made a bar of seven white breakers as
it reached the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is from here, on, that one gets the moccasins,” Hilary
said. “If any rum-runners come by this swampy bit,
they’ll meet their match.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went warily forward, lighting themselves with their
last copies of <span class='it'>La Nacion</span>. They met with no moccasins,
but as they crossed the swampy patch by the causeway,
the croaking of the bull-frogs hushed for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This was the sort of place the Conquistadores landed
in,” Hilary said. “Cortés landed in just such another,
and burned his ships on the beach behind him. When we
go down the coast, we will draw the very beach where he
landed. Imagine landing like that, a thousand miles from
any store, or any friend, in an unknown world. It was a
lonely night for those fellows, when their ships were burned
and they turned inland to what was waiting for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not pity them too much,” Margaret answered.
“They were there from choice, mainly from greed; nor
were they novices at the work. They had also three great
advantages, guns, horses and Cortés. The prizes to be won
were enormous, and the dangers to be faced only thirst,
which was probably chronic with them; hunger, which
they must have known in Spain; and death, which they
would have had on the gallows if they had not emigrated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see all that,” he said; “yet there it is. Cortés came
to the difficult new thing and did it. Then four hundred
years afterwards, fellows like me appear, who write how
Cortés did it and how he ought to have done it. Do you
think that we last fulfil a function?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had now turned off on their way to the house
through the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Hilary,” she said. “It is even called a kind of
wisdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in her tone made him pause to look at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite see your point,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a kind of wisdom,” she said, “to be wise after
the event.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later they came in sight of the bulk of the
house looming up among the trees. A light from a scullery
window shone directly upon their path, making the tops
of the leaves to glisten like silver. As they came to the
sight of this window, they both smelt on the instant a flavour
of hot bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve come back,” Margaret said. “They have
brought a candle to the scullery and Tia Eusebia is making
the hot rolls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m blest,” Hilary said. “But you’re right;
there is Tia Eusebia, taking away the candle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder where they have been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall soon know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They hurried past the out-houses and up the steps to
the door. Hilary knocked. After an interval Ramón and
Eusebia opened to them. Both the old servants were
flustered. They closed the door carefully behind Margaret
and Hilary and then began to tell in swift soft Spanish of
the wonders which they had seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have both been great sinners and thankless for
God’s great mercies, O Señor and Señorita, but henceforth
we shall live in sight of the throne, having been called,
having been chosen. O the beauty and the grace and the
sweetness that we have known this night. She, Herself,
who is all good and grace, looked upon us and blest us.
The most blessed Virgin has trodden upon these soils, O
Señorita and Señor, and all the Blessed Fellowship will
follow where she has trodden, and all the devils will be
driven away. And the man with the two heads has gone
already from by the blasted pine, and Black Peter with his
tongue out has gone, and old Master that used to look
sideways with yellow eyes, ran straight away out to sea,
where all the lost go, and oh, hallelujah, hallelujah, be
Thou seven times blest, O seven times Wounded One!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has happened, Ramón?” Hilary asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Señor, the woman Lotta is surely a great saint,
with all inner perfection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary hoped that it might be so, but doubted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where have you been, Ramón?” he asked. “We
have been to and fro, shouting for you. Did you not
hear us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Señor, yes, but we could not turn to you, having
Her before us. The most blessed Virgin was at the Cross
of the Stranger near the forest edge. Lotta ran to tell
us, and we all ran, and oh it is blessed grace to be so blest
as to behold, and oh joy, she looked upon us and blessed
us; and oh joy to be set free, and oh bliss to be white
who before was scarlet; oh triumph, oh glory; hallelujah,
hallelujah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For oh Lord, Señor Hilario, she was there, shining
in her glory, in a blue skirt and white lace mantilla, and
all diamond glory spangles and hairpins of purest gold,
oh hallelujah, come down to set us free from wicked
flesh and all damned temptation; and her face shone,
and oh her voice, my dear, her voice, it was like a ripple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many were privileged to behold her?” Margaret
asked. “Were there any beside yourselves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lotta and Jorge and Marianela, and we two, Ramón
and Eusebia, by special grace, and the two from Los Jardinillos,
Pablo Paloverde and his wife; we seven; only
we seven of all the world: we seven dreadful deadly sinners;
and now we are ransomed and released, and the precious
grace comes floating in; oh sing and give thanks; oh
sing before the throne, sing the glad happy psalm, knock
the timbrel of glory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here both the two old servants became possessed by
religious excitement. Ramón’s words for the last two
minutes had been running in a rhythm, now they became
almost a song. The two old heads went back, their eyes
closed, while their bodies began to sway in a dance, to
which their hands kept time. “Oh,” they sang,</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Oh, we are come into the glory,</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, shout aloud: salvation.</p>
<p class='line0'>By the cross of the stranger, glory</p>
<p class='line0'>Salvation shake the whole world: joy.</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, the blessed Virgin give us glory,</p>
<p class='line0'>Glory, oh, fire off the pistols, brothers,</p>
<p class='line0'>Little sisters set the bells ringing.</p>
<p class='line0'>Burst something, brothers, oh salvation.</p>
<p class='line0'>O ho ho ho ho hallelujah,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Hallelujah, hallelujah, ho.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>They were no longer of this world, nor conscious of it:
they went dancing back to the kitchen, with hallelujahs.
A jar or pot boiled over as they entered, with an overwhelming
wash of sputter and crackle. A flood of smoke
shot up from the mess with a smell of burnt dinner. Ramón
seized the offending pot and cast it on the floor, singing:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Never mind the little things, happy Ramón,</p>
<p class='line0'>The little things of this world, happy Ramón,</p>
<p class='line0'>For you have seen the joyous, happy Ramón,</p>
<p class='line0'>Lady in the blue skirt, happy Ramón.</p>
<p class='line0'>But, oh, the Lord, the saucepan burn my fingers!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Hilary and Margaret watched the dance from the kitchen
door. They had heard that miraculous visitations were
frequent along the coast and that when they came they
filled the lives of those visited for two days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So they have seen the Virgin,” Margaret said. “They
will need us no more to-night. We had better take a few
more <span class='it'>Naciones</span> and go off to Paco’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he stooped to gather up the pile of newspapers, he
heard distinctly a noise of whistling within the closed
sitting-room at the end of the passage. A man was whistling
“Charmante Gabrielle” in the stumbling way of a
man who does not sing well. Margaret heard it at the
same time. The suddenness and nearness of it startled
them both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody in the sitting-room,” Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it happened, the sudden startling of the two made
an impression on the two ecstatics in the kitchen. Ramón
came out of his trance and became, in part, the old butler
of daily life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” he said, “I believe, Señor, that I never told
you that a gentleman has called to see you. He is in the
sitting-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What gentleman? Who is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very old Lutheran padre, Señor. He came to see
you a few minutes before you came in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Lutheran padre? What is his name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But here Eusebia interrupted with a cry. She had
been rocking herself to and fro in a rocking-chair, with
her apron over her face; now she sprang up in excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, be joyful,” she cried, “for the holy footsteps.
Wherever the blessed feet tread, there come the lovely,
lovely flowers. Oh, I feel them grow! Oh, I feel the angels.
Catch old Tia, Ramón; give me your hand for the Lord’s
sake; we will be caught right up to the throne together.
Oh, I hear the harps! Oh, I hear the singing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear them,” Ramón cried, taking his wife’s hand.
“They sing tirra-lu, tirra-lu, just like the lovely band.”</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Come on to the throne, Tio Ramón.”</p>
<p class='line0'>“I am coming, Tia Eusebia.”</p>
<p class='line0'>“There shines the Lord.”</p>
<p class='line0'>“O, the little glittering feet!”</p>
<p class='line0'>“I see the long white beard of Father Abraham.”</p>
<p class='line0'>“Oh, the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost.”</p>
<p class='line0'>“Halle-halle-halle-hallelujah,</p>
<p class='line0'>The beauty of the Lord is joy.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“A Lutheran padre?” Hilary said. “That sounds
harmless. The only Lutheran padre here is old Skinner,
who runs the Sailors’ Mission. He is a very fine old man.
Shall we go to him, or leave him and go to Paco’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it be Mr. Skinner, we must go to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment the whistling stopped, the door of
the sitting-room opened, and an old man, with a long
white beard, moved slowly out to them with the shuffling
shamble of old age. He spoke with the voice of an old,
educated man, from one of the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this Miss Kingsborough?” he was saying. “Is
that you, Mr. Kingsborough? I was not quite sure, but
thought that I heard voices in the hall, besides your servants.
You will forgive my coming in like this, to wait for you.
I see you don’t remember me, Mr. Kingsborough; my
name is Brown, Abner Brown. You have forgotten that
you met me at the Club the other night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, I was one of a crowd; quite a lot went
there. We were talking after dinner that night about
international crime prevention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I remember the talk,” Hilary said. “So you
were there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was there with Colonel Mackenzie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my first night at the Club,” Hilary said. “I
was introduced to so many. You must forgive my not
remembering you. Margaret, will you let me introduce
Mr. Brown: my sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While you talk,” she said, “I will see about some food.
The household is a little disorganised.” There was not
much light in the hall, but she looked hard at Mr. Brown
and went into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come into the sitting-room, Mr. Brown,” Hilary said.
“What can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am an American minister, Mr. Kingsborough,”
Mr. Brown replied, as they walked back to the sitting-room
together. “I am here, engaged in getting information
about this rum-running. I was in Colonel Mackenzie’s
office an hour or two ago, when Richard Shullocker, the
club porter, came in, to say that you had been threatened,
or warned or told of some risk or other. No, I don’t
ask you if that be so or no, nor for any details, but I just
felt it to be my duty just to look in, Mr. Kingsborough,
and I will tell you why. You have a man up the road
here, a young fellow, of the name of Paco; Enrique Paco,
to whom I owed a small sum for horse-hire. I was driving
out to pay this to Paco, and I said to Colonel Mackenzie
and to Richard Shullocker, ‘I will tell you what I will
do,’ I said. ‘Don’t trouble to send out guardias or vigilantes
to them. No,’ I said, ‘for I have to go out to Paco’s
on a matter of business, and coming back from Paco’s,
as I pass the gate of their house, Los Tamales, or whatever
it may be, I will stop my horse-car or caleche, or country-surrey,
and offer Mr. Kingsborough a ride into town.’
So now, Mr. Kingsborough, there it is, I have paid Paco;
and my surrey, though not exactly a White Surrey, is
at the gates of your house, at your service, ready to drive
you and your sister in to Las Palomas. You could have
rooms at the hotel, for I took occasion to ask that at the
hotel, before I came out to Paco’s. And I guess you would
both feel easier in your minds away from this place, miles
out in the forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Brown,” Hilary said; “we are most
grateful for your thought and for the offer. We were
on our way to Paco’s to hire his buggy to take us to Las
Palomas, as we thought it best not to neglect the warning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is sure sound sense, Mr. Kingsborough, near
a seaport town like this. And if you will excuse me the
observation, Mr. Kingsborough, your servants, though
I guess you hired them along with the house, are not quite
in the frame of mind to repel boarders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I ask if it was the Adventist, from San Mateo
Obispo, got them into their present state?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not the Adventist; but they saw a miraculous
appearance in the clearing not far from here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it will be three days before anyone gets an hour’s
work from them. Oil in the coffee, chilis in the bread, eggs
in the shoes—oh, don’t I know these soul’s awakenings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in the man’s tone jarred Hilary. He looked
a most benign old man, with a fresh colour, bright eyes
and long white silky beard. He had the appearance of
Father Christmas. Yet this last remark, about the spiritual
excitements of others, struck Hilary as hard and vulgar.
He looked at Mr. Brown and decided that here was something
hard and ugly about the man’s mouth, for all that
holy white hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mr. Kingsborough,” Mr. Brown continued,
“I don’t want even to seem to be in a hurry or to be pressing
you. Miss Kingsborough spoke of preparing some food.
Well: food is the best remedy yet found for hunger; I’ll
say nothing against food. But meanwhile, can’t I be
moving some bags or things for you out to the surrey?
Miss Kingsborough will want a warm wrap: the breeze
is setting in; and though it is only a mile or two into
town, it is going to be cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you,” Hilary said, “it won’t take a minute
to get all that we need.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, surely,” Mr. Brown answered. “No, indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down away from the light, and dusted his hat
with his handkerchief. A restraint came upon the conversation.
Mr. Brown felt the chill and tried to remove it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is this rum-running which leads to all the crime
along this part of the coast,” he said, “This republic
is a very nice republic: I don’t say it isn’t, but it’s as
slack as one of these republics always is so long after any
revolution. The public services are away down. Then
that old sinner, the Dictator, Don Manuel, out in Santa
Barbara, sees a chance to profit. He can make rum,
in his sugar-plantations, which have every natural power
just beside them, water power as well as fuel, and all just
near the sea, for not any more than five or seven cents
a gallon. In a good year I guess he might get it out as
low as even three cents for a gallon. Mind you, Mr.
Kingsborough, I’m speaking of a low grade of rum.
Santa Barbara can’t compete with Jamaica, nor with
Santa Cruz; but it is rum; it scratches as it glides; as
they say. Well, now, say, he makes it at as high as seven
cents. He can get it aboard his big power lighters and
land it on the coast here at twenty cents the gallon. Then,
what with mule teams and palm-oil and what is known
here as the underground railway, he can get it up as far
as the mines in Palo Seco for half a dollar. Now in
Palo Seco he has no opposition, Mr. Kingsborough. No
other rum has a geographical chance of coming in. Well,
now, in Palo Seco, where I have been, studying this question,
he can sell that rum and has been selling that rum for
close upon two years, to gold-miners, who care not one
jack-straw what they pay nor what they drink, as long
as it scratches as it glides. He sells that rum, which
cost him, say, seven cents to make and forty-three cents
to transport, for from eight to twelve American dollars:
yes, sir, two or three dollars the quart. I’ve seen him do
it, or at least his agents. Now that is a good business,
Mr. Kingsborough, even allowing for losses, thefts and
the squaring of the vicious circle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?” Hilary asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The vicious circle is this Occidental police, Mr. Kingsborough.
They say a perfect circle can’t be squared;
but this circle I guess has got a kink in the loop half the
way around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Colonel Mackenzie is a good man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sure, Mr. Kingsborough, he’s a wonderful man,
but he’s not been in the police yet a quarter of a year.
Still, that’s the business he’s up against. It’s a business
run by old fox Don Manuel, in Santa Barbara, with all
the resources of a thriving state to back him. But we
are going to have it stopped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In your investigations into this rum-running, Mr.
Brown, did you ever hear of or come across a man called
Hirsch, nicknamed Sagrado or Sagrado B., now living
in Santa Barbara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sagrado, you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the Holy One.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you’ve got the name wrong, Mr. Kingsborough;
there’s no holy one in Santa Barbara. I guess you mean
Sangrado, a blood-letter. They have a whole alphabet
of them. But Hirsch and Sagrado, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was warned against that man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess it will be some nickname or gang-name. May
I ask who it was who warned you, Mr. Kingsborough,
against this man Hirsch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An Occidental?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of Las Palomas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you recognise him again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you describe him to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mr. Brown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite right, Mr. Kingsborough; quite, quite right.
I was wrong to suggest it. But I would put all thought
of there being any Holy One in this business right out
of your mind. That is probably a nickname for their
headquarters: very likely Don Manuel himself, who prides
himself on his religion. No, sir; you’ve been warned
(as I see it) because they think you may be a spy. Anyway
without you here they could land stuff on this beach.
They have warned several people off the track, up and
down the coast, in the last eighteen months. They all
had the sense to take the hint. All except one, I think;
one did not. He was a good while ago, before you came
here. Prince, his name was, Jacob Galls Prince; lived
on the coast like you, up at San Agostino.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened to him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He neglected the warning, so then they took steps.
The first time he had friends with him who drove them
away, but the second time they gave him his pass all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary thought that Mr. Brown’s tone, when he spoke of
the giving of the pass, was suddenly savage. He noticed
that Mr. Brown’s mouth tightened as he spoke, as though a
lid were being snapped down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were the murderers caught?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, there’s a lot too much money behind these
fellows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you in the United States Police, Mr. Brown?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, I’m just plain Abner Brown, from Brownstead,
Massachuzzits. I’m a minister of Brownstead Light-Arising
Church. I’m in this rum-investigation business,
because I hate rum like hell. Yes, Mr. Kingsborough, like
hell. Maybe you’ll think that strong talk for a minister
of a church that goes dead against any language that’s
anyways got a kick. But I guess it’s not too strong. Mr.
Kingsborough, I believe that if rum were wiped clean off
of this planet this planet would just rise up three hundred
per cent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where would it rise to, Mr. Brown?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rise to the Light, Mr. Kingsborough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think it would do then, Mr. Brown?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would enter into a new plane of being, Mr. Kingsborough,
which lies just beyond anything we have going
now. I guess the prophets saw it: a new world: gee, I
guess it’s worth working to try to bring. All your dividends
and worldly cares just dumped where they belong, and all
your spiritual being three hundred per cent pure light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds delightful,” Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be all it sounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I daresay,” Hilary said. “But would it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you are not an optimist, Mr. Kingsborough?
However, there it is. Meanwhile could you let me know the
right time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two minutes to eight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your time correct?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Correct by the noon gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two minutes to eight. I must be slow. I make it no
more than three and a half minutes to eight.” He busied
himself with his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret from the kitchen gave a call of “Oh, Hilary!”
Hilary opened the door and called back:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want me, Margarita?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you come here just a moment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary excused himself to Mr. Brown and hurried along
the corridor to the kitchen, which was in some confusion.
Dark smoke wreathed about the ceiling: the table was
still set with some preparations for a meal: there were
several broken plates, dishes, sprigs of herbs and limes upon
the floor, but the negroes were gone. The place stank of
burnt oil; great greasy smuts floated on the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve gone again,” Margaret said. “They have
been beyond all bounds. Oh, Hilary, I have had a
marvellous time with them. At first they kept going into
paroxysms of prayer and giggles, and dropping things on
the floor. Then they started behaving like raging lunatics;
they upset the oil on to the fire. They almost had the house
on fire, but I have managed to beat it out. They danced
while I was doing this, so I told them to go out to see their
appearance again, which they have done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you burnt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I had known that you were having this trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m very glad you didn’t. What does this Mr. Brown
want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To drive us into Las Palomas. We had better go. He
has a carriage waiting at the gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you make of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a minister in the Light-Arising Church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think he is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t like his mouth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t take to his mouth, myself,” Hilary said. “But
he isn’t a minister in the sense that a priest is a priest.
He’s a commercial traveller in an intellectual light co., with
a bonus of thirty cents a soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you meet him at the Club?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t remember: I may have: I met so many that
night. But I think you may put all suspicion of him out of
your mind, Pearl, because he comes, really, from Colonel
Mackenzie’s office. That Harker man told me that word
had been sent to Colonel Mackenzie, about our being
threatened. Well, this fellow Brown was in Mackenzie’s
office when the message came. It seems that he knows the
Pacos and was coming here to see them anyhow, and so he
volunteered to bring us back with him to Las Palomas.
He arrived in a buggy (at least he calls it a surrey) while
we were down by the creek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am all ready to start for Las Palomas,” she said. “I
ran upstairs, after you had gone into the room with him,
to pack a few things for both of us. They are in handbags
on the ledge in the hall. The only question is, shall we
not get out here and go alone? I don’t quite like this Mr.
Brown. I think he’s a bad man. His mouth snaps to
just like a trap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he is old and alone, and I think that he must
certainly have been at Colonel Mackenzie’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said. “It is that which weighs with me.
I suppose it is all right; but I’m uneasy to-night: so
many unusual things are happening. Oh, whatever is
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That” was the running down of the weights in the old
English kitchen clock which had been Tia Eusebia’s pride
for many years. With a sudden jarring, chirring and
dropping noise, these weights dropped themselves, a little
door opened, a little man appeared, who jerked himself
forward and backward eight times as the bell behind him
struck the hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eight o’clock. What a shock it gave me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t stay here. This place is on our nerves to-night:
we had better go. And I should say, go with this
man in his surrey buggy, or whatever it is he calls it. It is
two or three lonely miles to town: if he will drive us, all
the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not feel at ease about it, Hilary. I have misgivings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t, because I know now that Mackenzie will be
looking out for us. It is all right. Come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right. Come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave the lamp for Ramón.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They left the lamp burning, but turned it down: then
they went into the corridor and closed the kitchen door
behind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing which they noticed on coming into the hall
was a draught of air (blowing in from the sitting-room)
which was causing the lamp to smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” Hilary said, “I shut the sitting-room door when
I came out. Mr. Brown must have opened it. The draught
is from there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must have opened the window too,” Margaret said.
“This is the breeze.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The window was shut when I left the room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it blew open,” Margaret said. “It sometimes
does if the catch be not pushed home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The catch was pushed home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary picked up the two little handbags from the ledge,
thinking that this Mr. Brown had a pretty cool cheek to go
opening people’s windows and making their lamps smoke.
He walked along to the sitting-room door, carrying the bags;
Margaret was just behind him. He pushed the door open
and came well into the room. A gush of air blew past him
on the instant, for the window opening into the verandah
was wide open. “Come in, quick, and close the door,
Margarita,” he said. “This window’s wide open.”
Margarita closed the door to save the hall lamp; they were
thus both within the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary saw at a glance that Mr. Brown had not only opened
the window, but had moved the lamp to the corner near the
fire-place. “He has a pretty cool cheek,” he thought again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brown was standing near the open window, facing
them, with his hands behind his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, Mr. Kingsborough,” Mr. Brown said. “I see
you have done your packing, so we can start right away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary felt quickly that there was something wrong and
deadly. There was that rasp in Mr. Brown’s voice and
that snap upon his mouth; and besides these things, he
stood still, and there was something in his last five words
which sounded like a signal, and thirty years seemed to fall
from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” he repeated, “we can start right away.” His
hands came up from behind him with a flash and a bang:
something very hot struck Hilary in the chest with a pang
and a thud which came together: a little, slow bluish
smoke twisted out of Mr. Brown’s pistol: Hilary found
that he was on the floor. He heard Margarita cry aloud.
He tried to rise, but the place rocked so and surged: there
was a sort of tight red wave which got into his eyes. Then a
lot of people seemed to dance out of the night into the
room; they seemed to dance all over him; they seemed
to be dancing with Margarita, and there was a smell of a
cigar which was pushed red-hot into his cheek. After that,
he knew that he climbed to his feet, and that somebody
grinned in his face; then the water seemed to fall all off
the mill-wheel into a peacelike sleep or death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything seemed to be over when he came to himself
again. The dancing was done. Men were going out of the
room by the verandah window: they were carrying a great
package which moaned and seemed to be moving, much as
a fly, trussed up by a spider, will move. He felt a weight
in his chest and found it difficult to understand what was
happening. Then he realised that the moaning package
was Margarita, who was being carried away by all these
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Margarita,” he said, “I will set you free.”
The words which he spoke did not seem to be these, because
the men laughed. He said, “I’ll teach you to laugh,” and
tried to rise from the floor, but the floor rocked all round
him, so that he had to lie down again. He shut his eyes
to make the floor steady, but it did not become steady. He
tried to steady it with his hands, then it started spinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he managed to sit up. A man was looking
down upon him; the man’s hat was cocked on one side, he
was smoking the stub of a cigar and staring at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Bloody Kingsborough,” the man said. “My dear
old college pal, dammit. You’ve no memory of me. You
haven’t been introduced to me. I’m one of the vulgar
lower orders, dammit. Sumecta, my name is. I’m a
fellaw, dammit, a rude vulgar low fellaw. And I’m going
to cork your eyebrows with my cigar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaped upon Hilary and rubbed the burning cigar
along his eyebrows. Hilary noticed that the man wore
earrings and had a wide mouth lacking one tooth. The
man straddled across him and slapped his cheeks and puffed
cigar-smoke into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Sumecta,” he said. “And you’ve got no London
police force here. You can’t order the horrid man away.
Your sister’s going to Mr. Holy B, and nothing that you can
do can stop us. You won’t see your sister again, because
the Chief wants her. The Chief wants her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another man appeared behind Sumecta: he was a little
elderly man with an inflamed face and a dirty rag about his
neck, covering a boil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t try to stop your sister going,” he said, “or you’ll
line an elmwood shell with name engraved. We’ll just
tample his dags, Sumecta, and then frolly the dusty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They emptied the cigarette-box and took a drink or two.
The little man began to sing a song:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Travelling with the lady,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;You’d best pull down the blind,</p>
<p class='line0'>Make it cosy and shady .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>He came round the table close to Hilary and danced a little
breakdown, with two of Hilary’s cigarettes in his mouth.
“O I’m a lady, a Hottentot lady,” he sang. “One-time-piecee
lubly gal, O.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll singe my college pal’s lips,” Sumecta said. “Baillon
de cigare chaud.” He straddled down over Hilary, sucked
his cigar to a glow and prepared to burn his victim’s lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut that out, Sumecta,” Mr. Brown said, at the window.
“Come on here, the two of you. The train’s just going.”
Mr. Brown’s beard was sticking out of his pocket, but his
white eyebrows were still in place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men followed Mr. Brown through the window,
which they closed behind them. Mr. Brown opened it
again an instant later, to take a last look round the room.
Mr. Brown seemed to have no further interest in Hilary,
he neither spoke to him nor looked at him. Hilary to him
had been simply something to shove aside and leave.
After they had gone, Hilary heard footsteps and voices;
presently the light went out; he was alone in the dark. A
bat flew about the room after insects; presently it knocked
down a tumbler which dripped water on to the floor for a
long, long time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tio Ramón and his wife did not see the miraculous
appearance again, though they waited in the clearing, near
the stone, till after eleven. They then walked to Las
Palomas, and heard a midnight office at a monastery, then
stayed on praying in side-chapels of the church till after
dawn. After some more prayer and the offering of all that
was precious in their apparel to the image in a side-chapel,
they walked and partly danced to Los Xicales. They did
not enter the house even then, for they had to compare
notes with Lotta at the lodge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At eight in the stormy morning, they found Hilary lying
in a chair in the sitting-room, in pain and fever. In the
wild weather Tio Ramón summoned Paco, who summoned
Enrique, who sent Lotta to find Miguel, who shook his
head, and thought it better to call Enobbio. Enobbio was
an elderly Italian with a clear wit; he at once rode in to
Las Palomas and called a doctor and Colonel Mackenzie.
By midday Los Xicales was thronged by detectives, who
looked mysterious and took a lot of measurements and
shook their heads. Their Indian trackers said that there
were seven men concerned in the raid and that two were
“little Indians”; that five, including the Indians, had
come from the beach, while the other two had driven from
the north, in a buggy, which had waited at the gate for
some time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the raid (the trackers said) the men had carried
Margarita to this buggy and had driven her away. Lotta,
Lotta’s children, Ramón and Eusebia, all admitted that
they had seen the buggy go past, full of men, and that they
had heard a woman among them crying for help, but they
had not known that it was more than a joke. They had not
noticed where the buggy went after it passed them; but
this the trackers explained. It drove out of the forest by
the city road, turned to the left, and crossed the savannah
to the beach. Near the beach it stopped, five of the men
carried Margarita to the water; there, presumably, they
found a boat and put to sea. The two men remaining
in the buggy drove off to Las Palomas, where all trace of
them disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rain was heavy before noon: the tracks were rained
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No further trace or track was found. No more evidence
was forthcoming. Enobbio had seen a stranger looking
for a lost bicycle; but this stranger was proven to have
been Sard Harker, mate of the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>, which had now
sailed. Acting on Enobbio’s evidence, the police recovered
Richard Shullocker’s bicycle, but found no trace of Margarita.
Hilary’s story of the events was not very clear.
He could repeat only what he could remember of Sard’s
story, which he had not much wished to hear, and of
Abner Brown’s story, which had not told him much. He
maintained that the abductors were mixed up with Santa
Barbara and with the boxing hall, the Circo Romano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ben Hordano was questioned, but his movements on
the night of the raid were well known: he had been drunk
by six, disorderly by seven, and in jail by eight. One
curious thing, which none could explain, was how the man
Abner Brown knew that Richard Shullocker had warned
Colonel Mackenzie of an intended raid at Los Xicales.
The warning had been given privately, in person: no one
could possibly have overheard it. Paco and his son
Enrique denied having had any dealings (horse-hire or
other) with anyone outside their hamlet. This denial
was backed by sufficient proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Mackenzie, acting on Richard’s warning, had
sent two patrols to Los Xicales during the night of the raid,
but as one had gone at midnight and the other at four in
the morning, and both had shrunk from the weather, neither
had seen anything suspicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those days there was no direct cable to Santa Barbara.
A message thither had to be cabled to the Florida station,
thence to Punto Poniente, thence to Tres Dientes, and
thence on. The Santa Barbara police declared that they
knew of no one known as Mr. B. or Sagrado B., and that
if the raid had been carried out by one of the liquor gangs,
which seemed possible, those liquor gangs were composed
of Occidentales, not of men from the State of Santa
Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary had been wounded in the wall of the chest by an
American revolver bullet. He was in bed with his wound
for thirteen days. On the fourteenth day he heard the
final reports of the police, that they did not know where
his sister was, and that they had no clue whatsoever to her
abductors. The story had by this time reached the
American and English newspapers. A question was asked
in Parliament, whether it were true that an Englishwoman
had been abducted by brigands in Las Palomas, and whether
Her Majesty’s Ministers were making such representations,
etc., etc., as would, etc. The Ministers replied that they
had heard the report, and that they had every confidence
in Her Majesty’s representatives on the spot and in the
police of Las Palomas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Mackenzie, who was newly in charge of that
police, had less confidence. He told Hilary privately
that many in the Occidental police force were bribed by
the liquor gangs, and that in this case they were determined
not to help. Hilary asked whether it would be any use to
look for Margarita in Santa Barbara. “Do you yourself
think that she will be there?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t, Mr. Kingsborough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Hilary said, “we know that the raiders were
not Occidentales, and that they took her away by sea.
The men at the boxing-match said that the raid was planned
by a Santa Barbara leader, who had some grudge against
us. My sister said that there was one man with a grudge
against her. Why should not an international ruffian of
that sort, speaking all tongues, establish himself at Santa
Barbara, work with the liquor-smugglers, and use his
gangs to gratify his grudge when he heard of our presence
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a theory, Mr. Kingsborough; but remember,
that it is very unlikely that members of a gang would talk
in public of their gang’s headquarters without any disguise
whatsoever. If they spoke of Santa Barbara, be sure
that they meant some other place. Santa Barbara is a
big place, however, with seven hundred miles of coast.
However, I had a flimsy from Santa Barbara this morning;
here it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite impossible Kingsborough lady landed here during
past fortnight. Paris Surete report the magician Hirsch
committed suicide Monte Carlo, 1894.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God! then, what do you suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That we may put aside this Santa Barbara theory as
untenable. Let us waste no further time on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What other theory have you? Who would have taken
my sister? What motive could anyone have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know who took your sister, Mr. Kingsborough,
but I am working and hoping to find out. The motive is
obvious to anyone who has had the honour to see your
sister: she is a very beautiful woman. That was the
motive, as I read the case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where do you suppose she is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope to find out and restore her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that she has been shipped to some damned
tolerated house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Kingsborough, it is no good thinking thoughts
like those: that way madness lies. I believe that we shall
find your sister wherever she may be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Hilary said, “I believe that she is in Santa
Barbara, in spite of all your beliefs, and I shall go there to
look for her. At least, if I go there, I shall be following
the only clue there is. And I shall see that mate of the
<span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> and get descriptions from him of those men at
the boxing-match.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unfortunately, Mr. Kingsborough, the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> has
not yet arrived at Santa Barbara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What; not in a fortnight, running dead to leeward?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s overdue?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not yet; but making a bad passage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has she been met with?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. She has not been reported.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there a single thing in this,” Hilary cried, “which
doesn’t go dead, dead against us? I’ll see whether the
Dictator of Santa Barbara is as helpless as a bribed bureaucracy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was unjust to Colonel Mackenzie, but then he was
young, very fond of Margarita, shaken by his wound, and
new to reality of any kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Mackenzie was sorry for him, but sorrier for a
very lovely woman in the hands of ruffians.</p>

<h2>PART THREE</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>hen Sard</span> found that his bicycle was gone, he
thought that the lodge-keepers had taken it
within the lodge. He knocked at the lodge
door to ask; getting no answer, he looked within: the
lodge was empty, the bicycle was not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was dim in that track through the forest: Sard struck
a match to see what marks were on the ground. The earth
was still moist from the rains. Two or three matches showed
him that someone with long feet had taken two strides out
of the road, wheeled the bicycle into the road and had then
ridden away upon it. The tyre tracks were firmly printed
on the road; the thief was no doubt heavy as well as tall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard had never been heard to swear, either on deck or
aloft; he did not swear now. He thought, “I am well
paid, for leaving it out of my sight in a place like this.
But he cannot be more than five minutes ahead of me, and
may be only a minute. If I run, I may catch him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took two more matches, carefully examined the tracks
and made sure, mainly from the length of the feet, that the
thief was a tall negro, wearing boots which needed soling,
and that he was riding, not very fast, into the forest, away
from Las Palomas. “I’ll catch him,” he said, “but I’ll
have to be quick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set off at a slow lope along the forest road, thinking
that when he reached Enobbio’s, if he had not caught
the thief, he would have to hire a horse, and gallop back
to his duty. “I’m running it very close,” he said, “but
I’ll do it yet. If the worst comes to the worst, the police-boat
would run me on board, even if she’s out as far as the
Rip-Raps. I’ve got half an hour of possible time; if I
ride by the beach, thirty-five minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped at the bridge to have another look at the
tracks: they were still there, leading on towards Enobbio’s;
so he set off again, at a quicker pace, through the forest,
which was evil all about him all the time. He made good
way to the clearing, which shone from the forge fire. A
lamp was lit in the inn. Enobbio sat with his wife at a
table there, eating frijoles from earthen platters and
drinking wine and water from cups of horn. Sard hailed
them at the door:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-evening, señora and señor. May I intrude upon
your peace to ask: Have you seen anyone ride by on a
bicycle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, señor,” Enobbio’s wife said, “a negro rode by
two minutes past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was more than two minutes, my heart,” Enobbio
said, “for to my mind it cannot have been since we sat
down to supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Desire of my eyes,” his wife said, “it was when you
went to the forge for the bread. When I say two minutes,
I do not tie myself to a second, but to two minutes, which
the world knows to be a space of time. It was a space of
time since the negro rode past. I am not one, as it is well
known, like these giglots and inglesas and ayankiadas,
whom one sees in Las Palomas, may the Lord have
vengeance on them, shameless as they are, even as Jezebel,
always painting and purple-powdering and making their
eyes to shine with poison; I am not one, I say, like these,
to spend my time in noticing each male who passes and in
endeavouring to ensnare his soul. No, my heart’s affection,
Enobbio mio, when a male passes, I thank God that God
has created women differently, in such a way that they
can regard such passing with indifference. Therefore,
when a negro passes or when a white man passes, be he an
Emperor of Rome or decked even as a pumper in the fire-brigade,
I can control myself, I can think calmly, even as
St. Lawrence upon the gridiron, of other things. Therefore,
when this negro who so suddenly excites your jealousy,
rode past, I did not hasten to the clock of San Agostino,
nor yet to my confessor, nor to the Four Liars of Las
Palomas, where four clocks together tell each a different
time to a different road, to make sure of the precise instant
at which he passed. For to me, as one more dowered
with knowledge would have known, a negro is but a negro
and a passing a passing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This, O affection of my life,” Enobbio said, “no man
dare question. But, señor, permit us to request you to eat
and drink, reclining at your ease upon this chair, so that
you may enquire concerning this negro more as becomes
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, indeed,” Sard said, “would that I might;
but I am pressed both by spur and quirt, and cannot stay.
May I ask the señora whether she noticed in which direction
the negro rode, when it fortuned that he had the honour
to pass her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In which direction, joy of my hearth,” Enobbio asked,
“did this negro proceed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sun of my worldly life,” his wife replied, “it is said
that, at the allotting of talents, the Padre Eterno gave to
woman such talents as man would not sensibly feel the
need of. Even as, in equipping her with flesh, He allotted
to her that rib which man could not use and has not missed,
so in endowing her with mental faculties, which some call
reason and others soul, He chose those qualities of acuteness
which man, though made loutish by their lack, could
not, when he had them, use. Thus it comes about that
the wife blushes for her husband in conversation before
strangers. For, behold, had not the Padre Eterno deprived
you of such acuteness, you would have perceived that
sitting as I have been sitting, facing the open door, which
we have not yet to keep closed (as is our custom, señor,
later in the season, on account of the flies) I could indeed
perceive the approach of the negro upon the bicycle,
coming from the forest towards me, but not without showing
indecent curiosity could I tell into which direction he proceeded;
nor, as I have said, should I, in any case, have
observed, since as it is well known, a road is as a brook,
in which one regards what passes, but not what is past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Señor,” Enobbio said, “beyond the forge there are
three ways; to the sea, to the north and to the mines.
The negro must have ridden on one of these. Let us
examine the tracks, since there is light enough. Is it
possible that you should desire to stay this negro?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has stolen the bicycle, which I need.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us, then, be swift,” Enobbio said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tracks at the road-meet led away to the left, into
the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” Enobbio said, “it goes there, this wheel-track,
to the direction of the mines. You see, Camilla
mia, this thief will be one of the negroes of Los Jardinillos.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are indeed a thievish company,” Camilla said.
“But if the señor be swift, he will confound the thief in
the moment of his exultation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far is it to Los Jardinillos?” Sard asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It cannot take long if taken swiftly,” Camilla said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My love,” Enobbio said, “it is the half of a league, or
two kilometres. It would take the señor twenty minutes
or more, only to the clearing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may well be, my earthly consolation,” Camilla said,
“that if the señor should walk, or indeed trot, to Los
Jardinillos, his progress would not be swifter than a walk
or trot. But as my remark suggested, comrade of my
earthly trial, if the señor should proceed swiftly, his arrival
would be likewise swift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you lend me a bicycle or horse,” Sard asked, “so
that I can go in chase?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, we have neither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there anyone here who might lend either?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no one here with horse or bicycle. I have, by
the blessing of God, a small ass; but God has afflicted him
with worms, doubtless lest I should become proud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are there many negroes in Los Jardinillos?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are fifty, señor, and no whites. Doubtless you
know him who has taken your bicycle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not,” Sard said: “I am following so that I may
know him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enobbio did not answer this. Sard noticed that the
husband and wife looked at each other, with a look as
though the bottom had fallen out of their comprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly,” Enobbio said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly,” Camilla answered. They looked at each
other again. As in a Latin exercise, Sard was conscious of
a good many words “understood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly,” Enobbio said at last, in a different tone,
“the señor will carry weapons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a sailor,” Sard answered. “A sailor has always
ten weapons and a knife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw in a flash that he had no chance of retaking the
bicycle that night by himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a sailor,” he continued. “The bicycle was to
take me to the quay, where I must be in all speed. Has
anyone here a cart or conveyance to take me there, for
money paid, or had I better run?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paco has a horse, which is in Las Palomas this day,”
Enobbio said. “His son, Enrique, has a mule.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enrique is indeed by God’s mercy the owner of a
mule,” Camilla said, “but on this day he is with the
mule, packing stores to the railway siding for the
miners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A railway siding,” Sard said. “They might run me
to Las Palomas in a truck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rail does not run to Las Palomas, señor. It runs
from the mines of Tloatlucan to the seashore here, where
barges come for the copper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I had better run,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run,” Enobbio said, “run to Las Palomas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a league and a half.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so. I must be on board my ship within half an
hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you could not run more than a league. Stay,
señor, let me consult my wife. Tell me, my heart, is not
Miguel stabling horses each night in the old huts near the
salt-pans?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who knows what Miguel does? His doings, being
modernist, do not concern us, but rather stir our horror.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true, my life, that Miguel errs in mind, but not,
my delight, in heart. In his heart he may be the instrument
of good. Listen, señor. In less than one kilometre
north-east from this are salt-pans near the beach, with
huts. Run thither by this track to the right. It is likely
that at this time you will find Miguel there with the horses
of his occupation. He, for money if not for love, will lend
you a horse and ride with you, so that he may lead it back.
Say that I, Enobbio, sent you, knowing the goodness of
his nature. Thus will you reach your ship in time, and in
no other way can you do this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say that it is only <span class='it'>likely</span> that he will be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will be there, señor,” Camilla said; “he is always
there at this hour with his horses: never does he fail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may count quite certainly on his being there and
on his lending you a horse,” Enobbio said. “I, who am
Enobbio, will serve you as to bread and lodging for a year,
without reward, should he not be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will lend assuredly,” Camilla said, “to any señor
such as the señor whose need is as the señor’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard felt in her speech the insincerity of one anxious to
be rid of him: he made up his mind at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I reach the seashore by this path to the
right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly, señor. Miguel and the salt-pans are on
the seashore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, can I come at once to the seashore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly, señor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not a good path, save where men have gone,”
Enobbio said. “In fact, it is no path, but what is opposite
to path.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must risk that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard thanked them both for their kindness and apologised
for having disturbed them at their supper. He set off at
a fast trot along the path towards the salt-pans. He
meant to burst through the thickets to the seashore and then
run straight along the beach as hard as he could put foot
to it, to the water-front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a full three miles,” he thought, “even by the
beach; but with luck I can be there by half-past. The old
man will give me some grace, and the police-boat may be
there; but I’ll do it somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a couple of hundred yards from the clearing, he put
his arm before his eyes and thrust into the bushes towards
the sea. He judged that the sea beach would be about
half a mile from him and that he would save at least three-quarters
of a mile by going by the beach. The thought of
passing right under the walls of Los Xicales helped in his
decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He burst through his thicket into a sort of meadow of
tussocks, over which he made good time. Beyond the
tussocks the woods began again, shutting out all his bearings,
but by taking a departure he kept a straight course,
as he thought, from the point where he left the track.
Just inside the woods, when he came into them, was a
tangle of thorn along which he had to run for a hundred
yards before he could find a way through. He came out
on to a soft patch, which had harder ground beneath it,
though all was covered with the wreck of thorns which
the bog had killed. He floundered across it to the other
side, which was a rise of red earth covered with pines. He
skirted the rise to a point where it was split by a gully,
which barred his progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not more than a year or two before, some rains heavier
than usual had made all the upper ground a bog. This
from its weight had at last torn through the bank beyond
it and gone in a torrent of mud and water into a ravine
below. All along the sides of this ravine were the rampikes
of trees, killed by the stuff brought down, but still standing,
sometimes with half their roots laid bare. Not less
than fifty of these trees had already been picked and
sucked to their bones by the ravin of tropical life. They
now stood like a valley of bones come to life. They stood
up white in the dusk, waving their arms. Many of them
glistened with decay or with vermin shining from decay.
On many of them fungus had seized with a greed that
seemed to have purpose and plan. One quite near to
Sard was a tree grey with death, barkless to the tips and
swathed with a sprawl of fungus that was scarlet at its
fringes. It was as though the fungus had sucked out all
the blood from its victim, except these last drops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many trees had fallen into the ruin of the bog and now
lay there, submerged or half submerged in mud. The
antlers of their branches were white. Rank things had
sprouted out and hoisted themselves up by these prongs.
One bulk or stump of a tree which Sard saw in the swamp
was covered with xicales, all forward, in profuse blossom,
a mass of blue and white, crawled on by gorged flies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flowers like enormous flags shot up on firm fleshy stalks
among the morass. Some, which were very tall, had
whitish blossoms as big as faces, splotched with darkness
like faces; these seemed to lean forward and mow at
Sard; they were like ghosts, lean and intense, but very
beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that place of death, thick as death, sickly with the
forms and the smell of death, with that evil, low, over-abundant
life which brings death, had a sort of weltering
chuckle as though it exulted in its rottenness. The water
in its pockets droned to puddle below, there was a suck
of noise like that of a beast trying to get out, but sinking
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this danger barred Sard’s path in the worst possible
way: it shut him from the beach and from the port: it
ran north-west and south-east across his course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get across,” he said: “I’m not going to lose my
passage. Now that I have come this way, I will go this
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light was off the place and the sun was down, but it
was daylight still. He marked a place in the ravine, below
the xicales flowers, where he thought there would be a
fairly easy crossing. A fallen tree lay sloped there as a
safe approach or step into a pool of water which might be
forded or swum. Beyond the pool two great trees lay
locked together; they were barkless, like the rest, yet so
placed in the mud that Sard judged that he could cross by
them, or almost cross, to the further side of the gully.
The last two or three yards beyond the trees looked
dangerous, but not bad enough to stop him. It was quicker
to cross than to go round, whichever way he tried it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no time nor very good light for survey. He
made up his mind and went at it within thirty seconds,
quoting his sea-proverb of “the sooner the quicker.”
Blood-sucking water-midges were already at him in a
swarm: the drone of their horns called up their reserves:
a faint smoke of them was rising. He jumped like a cat
from tussock to tussock, scrambled over the roots of the
tree on to the trunk, steadied himself, and then balanced
like a tight-rope walker down the bole to the water. He
saw the whiteness of the pilled boughs in the ink of that
pond stretching deep down. He was amazed at the depth
of the water. “Better deep water than mud,” he said;
so in he went with a thrust which carried him across.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He edged along the nearer of the fallen trees, caught a
good hold of a bough, felt bottom with his feet, got one
foot against the bole, gave a great heave, and was instantly
backwards in the water with the broken bough on top of
him. He came up with his eyes full of touchwood, and
felt something run along his head. He brushed it off into
the water and caught his tree again: something ran along
his hand; he brushed it off, fearing a scorpion; but
instantly other things ran in its place. He shook them off
and backed away, till he saw that the things were wood-eating
beetles, whose colony he had disturbed. “A
scorpion would be a bore,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He trod water while he looked for a better place. He
swam in, caught a bough, swung himself up, and instantly
went backwards into the water for the second time with
the bough in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came up, somewhat troubled, for a third attempt.
This time he dodged in under the boughs, laid hold of the
body of the tree and hove his weight on to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a sort of flounder of deliberation, the tree moved
sideways to his weight, then tilted suddenly as the heavy
branches gave leverage, then it rolled over into deeper
water, carrying Sard down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard had learned in a hard school to look out, to know
when to let go and when to stand-from-under. He went
down with the tree as it rolled, right under water, so that
he never saw his hat again, but he kept above the tree and
emerged when it settled. Very cautiously he moved along
its bulk, as soon as it was firm, with the feeling that he was
riding a beast whose ways were not to be trusted. He
felt it waver in front of him and settle behind him as the
submerged boughs went deeper into the mud. There
came a sudden crack and drop, as these gave way: the tree
soused him to his waist and then steadied. It was just
then that he felt vicious pricking bites in his legs as the
leeches began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood upon the bole and had “a look-see.” The
second tree, which was to be his gang-plank to the shore,
was now further away than it had been. He could no
longer step to it from where he was. “A little more
swimming,” he muttered: so in he went to be done with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second tree was steady in the mud, but as he neared
it, he saw that the yellow-tail bees had a nest in the bole.
Away from the nest and dangling from the boughs, there
were strings of withered poison-ivy, which he knew both
by sight and from experience. He swam inshore as far
as he could to avoid these dangers, then scrambled up upon
the bole and slipped along it to the roots. A few bees
came round him, to make sure, but did not attack; he
dodged the poison-plant. He scrambled up the gabion of
roots, all tangled and earthed, to look beyond at the banks.
As he stood up, the cloud of water-midges settled down upon
him: ants came from earth of the roots to bite him: the
leeches of the pond bit and sucked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not liked the look of the banks from the other
side, but he liked their look much less from near at hand.
They were nine feet from him beyond a mud pond of
unknown depth. They rose rather steeply from this mud
pond, in a bulge of wet, red, oozing mud, which shone and
trickled. A few blades of grass grew out of this mud, but
not enough to give it firmness. The mass looked to be
bulging out to burst. A rain-storm more, or the weight
of a body trying to climb it, would bring it all down like
an avalanche out of which there would be no rising. The
bank of mud was eight or nine feet high: above it there
was a shoot of reeds sheathed in pale grey dangling and
shining husks. “If I can get hold of the reeds,” he said,
“I’ll be out of this in half a minute; if I can’t, I may
never be heard of again. That mud looks evil; but the
longer I look, the less I shall see. There’s a star already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking up from where he was, he saw a blackness of
trees above and beyond the reeds. Against the blackness,
the pale fluffy flowers of the reeds stood out like gun
sponges, with white moths, as big as humming birds,
wavering over them: above them a star appeared in a
sky changing from greenish to violet. It grew rapidly
darker: or, rather, objects became less distinct and the
pilled branches more uncanny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along,” he said. He clambered over the roots,
hung on by a root which stood his test, and edged out along
submerged roots till he touched the mud. It was soft,
bulging, full of evil, with neither foot nor hand-hold. “If
that should come down,” he said, “I shall be gulfed, like
that man in the <span class='it'>Venturer</span> who got under the wheat-tip in
the hold and wasn’t heard of till we got the hatches off in
Hamburg five months later. But with this difference: I
shall never be heard of again. The way to get up that mud
is to drive in stakes to climb by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were many branches ready to hand. He tore a
stake and thrust it into the mud. It sank in for three
feet as easily as if the mud were something softer than
butter. With a sobbing noise, followed by a gurgle, some
reddish water, rapidly turning to something black,
iridescent and semi-solid, exuded from about it. Sard
drove in a second stake above it, with a third above that:
at each thrust the bank quaked and water or liquid mud
exuded: there was also an ominous sag in the body of the
bank. “Neck or nothing,” Sard said. He drove in a
fourth stake and instantly swung himself up on to the
gabion or fan of the roots by which he held. He was only
just in time. The fourth stake broke the last strength of
the barrier: it gave outwards: a shoot of water spurted
it outwards: a swirl of running mud followed the shoot:
then it all came down with a crash, which picked up Sard’s
tree, canted it out to mid-gully, and dashed it against a
dam of other trees, on to which Sard was pitched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked himself up and slipped along a tree bole to
a hand-hold by which he swung himself up to safety,
just as the dam gave way. He was back almost at his
starting-point, wet to the skin, mud to the thigh, bitten,
sucked and foiled. The long pent-up seepings of the
rains poured down from the burst bank before him. “I’m
well out of that,” he thought, “but I’m going to cross
this gully; for it is the short way and I still have time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He trotted up the gully for a few yards, wondering at
the increase in the darkness since he stood there before.
It had seemed to him that his crossing had only taken
a minute, yet here it was sensibly darker; there were
now five stars in the heaven where before was one. He
broke a stake and sounded some of the going. It was
like sounding the vale of Siddim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then lifting his eyes from the mud, he started, for there
in the gully was the mound covered with xicale flowers.
“There,” he said, “I will try it there. I believe that
the xicale flowers are a sign. I shall get across there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At his feet, almost as though prepared for him, was a
heap of what had once been a tree, but was now a sodden
log easy to break into lengths. He picked up pieces of
this and laid or tossed them one by one as steps before
him in the marsh; then very swiftly, holding his stick
as a balancing pole, he ran across them to the stump covered
by the xicales. To his astonishment, it proved not to
be a tree at all, but a rock or sarsen, thrusting from a
patch of firm earth in which the xicales were rooted. He
edged round it carefully to the gully beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first two steps from the xicales were over his shoes;
his third and fourth, being parts of the same flounder, took
him over his knees, but brought him to the pikes of a tree on
which he could tread. Branches of this tree served as
treads to his going for the next six yards, but beyond those
six yards lay ten yards of bog, which he could not clearly
distinguish nor test. Here, for the first time, he began
to wish that he had not tried his short cut across country
to the beach. “All the same,” he said, “if I can get to
the beach in five minutes, or even ten, I’ll do it yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took a swift survey of the bog ahead of him: it did
not look easy; but he always held that it is better to be
in a difficulty than expecting to be in one. He took a note
of possible tussocks in a line, drew a breath, and set off
in a hop, skip and jump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hop took him to firmish tussock which squelched,
but gave him some support for his skip. The skip took
him to something very soft with a log about a foot beneath
the surface, from which he made his jump. The jump
took him into what had looked like grass, but which proved
to be weed-covered water: he went into it over his head.
He came out again, thinking fiercely of the <span class='it'>Pathfinder’s</span>
fo’c’sle-head and of that iron rail over which he ought
at that moment to be peering. The soft green grasses
gave before him; they stroked his face gently, they closed
in at the back of his neck, he felt them caress his body and
tremble along his legs and lay enfoldments about his
feet. When he thrust out his hands to swim, they sped
from him, for they were frail grass and he a strong man;
but before his stroke was made, they were back again:
he felt them at his chest; they touched his chin: they
rose from the water and touched his face. He swam
six strokes and then felt for bottom. There was bottom
at five feet: he touched it, but it went over his foot; he
wrenched the foot clear, but it went over his other foot;
he wrenched that foot clear, and, lo, all those soft little
frail grasses seemed to come all about him with a whisper,
and they were as heavy as lead and as strong as sailmaker’s
twine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever I do,” Sard said, “I must not fight these
things, but go where they will let me go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not afraid, but very cautious, knowing the
power of his enemy. He had once known a boy who had
been drowned by waterweed. “He was caught deep
down, where they are strong: at the surface they yield.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he yielded they also yielded; he floated clear;
the little soft grasses, fine as flax, unclasped their hands,
they whispered about him and let him go. Little moths
floated about the water and a bird somewhere in the
thickets made a plaintive cry. All that Sard could see
was what the bull-frog sees: gleams of water, little starry
blossoms on the grasses, ripples like steel, bubbles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned upon his back and swam thus for a few strokes
till he slid on to the mud in which the grasses were thickly
rooted. He gripped handfuls of the grass and pulled
himself forward, but they came from the mud into his
hand. When he pressed his foot down, the mud went
over it like softness’ self. Great bubbles gurgled up and
burst about him with the smell of decay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard reached forward till he could lay a hand upon
something ahead which looked like earth. It was firmer
than anything there; he drew himself to it, and pressed
himself up upon it. It gave beneath him, being very sponge,
but it did not collapse, it did not try to swallow him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much further,” Sard said. “A few feet more,
and I will be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said these words aloud, for the comfort of hearing
a voice. Instantly, from in front of him, came a splash
and scutter: things were swimming away from something
dark in the water; he could not see what the things were
nor the thing from which they swam. “They are snakes,”
he said, “and here is one of them coming at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struck at it. To his great relief, it gave a squeal
and dived from him. “Rats,” he said. “They have
a carcase here. I’ll get out of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw that the dark thing was a body. His first thought
was that it was a man, but groping forward, he was reassured:
it was one of the half-wild razor-back hogs
which the negroes allowed to stray in the woods there.
It had been drowned there some hours before and now the
rats were at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard had his hand upon it as he floundered forward,
when the texture of the stuff beneath his feet changed
suddenly from mush to something vicious. His feet,
sinking into it, were held: the stuff closed over his feet
and fastened them: he sank lower down: the stuff caught
him round the ankles. He knew on the instant that he
had met his match: he was gripped to his death as the
hog had been. If he did not get out of that quag in the
next minute, while he had his strength, the rats would
eat him there before dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put both hands on the hog’s back, pressing it down
and himself up. He dragged his right foot up, then slipped
sideways to his left, giving himself a nasty wrench. The
bubbles gurgled up all about him: they popped with a
flapping noise. He hove again, pressing with all his power
on the carcase; he got his right knee on to the body, and
urged it down into the mud; his left foot came out of the
mud; he stood up, balancing, on the corpse, for the next leap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I get into a place like that,” he said, “without anybody
to give me a purchase, I shall be posted as
missing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He peered ahead; but there was nothing to guide him;
all before him was bog: there were pools of water, juttings
of mud and grasses growing out of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I step into that,” he said, “I may never step back
to this pig nor forward to the bank, but be caught right
there. My best chance is a standing leap, to get as near
to the bank as may be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He measured it roughly as nine feet to hand-hold on the
bank. He gathered himself for it, swinging his arms,
above the unstable corpse which squeezed out the bubbles.
He launched himself violently forward into a mess which
gulfed him to the waist. He urged himself through this
for a foot of two, felt it drag him quietly back, made a
greater effort, got a purchase on some grasses, which
helped him for another two feet; then he floundered,
trampling on stuff which gave beneath him yet came
back folding over him. He thrust forward, but his feet
were fast; he fell on his face, the stuff surged up over
his back. He kept his head up and thrust with his hands
and wrenched with his feet. All the fat, weltering, bubbling
bog seemed to chuckle at having got him. The
bubbles burst in his face: they were as big as inverted
saucers and came from the heart of corruption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to die in a place like this,” he said.
“Come out of it, port main; up with her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old rallying cry timed his efforts: it was like one
man standing the scrimmage of a pack of forwards in
football. The bog gave an ounch of release, like a beast
smacking its lips. He got hold of something on the bank.
It had prickles on it, but it was solid and grew in dryness.
Then as he put his weight upon it, it came out of the ground
by the roots: a little avalanche of earth and stones came
over his head, blinding him for the moment with grit
in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not see; he could only flounder forward with
spread arms which availed nothing: the bog had him
fast for all his effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then his hand touched a liane brought down by the
bush. It was a double liane, tough as flax and as thick
as honeysuckle. He caught it and pulled on it, and instantly
a great flowering spray of xicale flowers came floundering
down from above, into his face. He saw them for what
they were. “Xicale flowers,” he said, “xicales. I’m
going to be saved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got both hands deeply into the lianes of the xicales
and pulled as he had never pulled, never, on any yard or
on any rope. Digging forward into the squash of the bog
he found something hard for one foot. “Oh, heave,”
he cried, as he had so often cried to his watch. “Oh,
heave, son, heave; oh, heave and start her; heave for
glory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found himself half out, with his right knee and side
on hard earth and his left leg stuck in the bog. He drew
deep breath for a minute, as once he had stopped to breathe
when beaten dead by a sail five years before. Then
gathering all his powers, he hove “all together,” and
emerged erect on sound earth, shaking with the strain,
and without his left shoe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Xicales,” he said, “you’ve saved my life. I knew
that you were mixed up somehow with my life; and
I’ll carry some of you with me in gratitude till I’m laid
in my grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked both flowers and leaves for his soaking pocket-book.
His hands shook: he was cold to the marrow
and filthy beyond description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do it yet,” he said. “But first I must make a
shoe of sorts, or I shall be lamed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He cut off his trouser-legs at the knees, with his knife.
With one of the pieces, folded fourfold, he made a shoe,
and with the other he made thongs which secured it as
a sandal to his foot. It was a rough and ready sandal,
but it stayed on when put. It was good enough to run on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not think of what the time might be. He roughly
judged that he could reach Las Palomas in twenty minutes
or twenty-five minutes by running along the beach with
all his might. Any waterman on the front would put
him aboard: the police-launch would take him. “I
can’t miss my passage,” he said, “I must be on board.
I told the old man I would be on board.” For the first
time he said to himself, “And the old man will give me
an hour’s grace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set off over the headland of the gully under the
clump of pines whose blackness he had seen from the mud.
It was soft but firm going on the pine-needles; the trees
over his head made a sighing which merged as he ran
into the sterner sighing of the water on the beach. At
the foot of the spur over which he had run, he came to
the outcrops of the springs all overgrown with azaleas.
They ran all along the foot of the spur, so thick with
blossoms that they looked like an unbursting wave which
was yet foaming at the crest. Over all the foam of blossom
the fireflies glowed and went out, now as many as stars,
now few, now like sparks, but always beautiful. Just
beyond them was the broad sea-beach, with the breakers
only fifty yards away. The sea was coming in, as it will
in a shallow bay, in half-a-dozen long lines, each glowing
with mild fire, shining as it neared the sand, then flashing
like the moonlight, as the wave burst, then gleaming
greenish, and showing the globes of the stars, as it wasted
and died out upon the sand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard burst through the azaleas to the sands, which
stretched along for a great distance right and left. To his
right (seemingly quite near) was a shining, which he knew
to be the river near Los Xicales; beyond it, in the darkness
of trees, was the house of his dream with one light burning.
All a vast expanse of night, the sea-beach, the forest, and
muttering water lay behind him. He rushed down to the
sea and let three breakers go over him to cleanse him from
the swamp and the leeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Sard Harker,” he said, “come on, port main,
up with her!” He broke into a steady run facing to the
Los Xicales light. The pine trees on the spit shut away
a view of the anchorage so that he could not see the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>;
he could only hope and put his best leg foremost.
“Upon them that <span class='it'>hope</span>,” he thought, “is His mercy.” He
ran at his steady pace which, as he knew, he could keep for
miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though it seemed so near, that shining on the sands,
which he knew to be the river, was a full half-mile away.
Before he had gone three hundred yards of it, he saw that
the sand just ahead of him was darker and shinier than the
sand under his feet. A memory of another dangerous sand,
far away on an English sea-coast, shot into his mind on the
instant, but the footing failed before he could stop. The
sand gave beneath the one foot and let in the other: ooze
of water shot up to the surface: he flung himself backwards
violently, and got out, but fell, and saw, or thought
that he saw, the surface of the sand shaking as though it
were laughing at him. He rolled himself clear, then rose
and looked at it. “That’s a pretty bad quicksand,” he
said. “I might get through, but from the pull on that
foot, I think that it would pull me down. Probably I can
get round the shoreward end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried, but failed: the shoreward end of the quicksand
was tropical bog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” he said, “I’ll swim round the seaward end.
It is only a hundred yards. I need not go far out. It will be
something to have the swamp washed off me again.” He
went knee-deep into the sea, with some misgivings, for the
shallows of all that coast are haunted with sand sharks,
which come right in to have the warmth of the sand. He
splashed as he went, to scare them. He had gone about
thigh deep into the water and was just settling down to
swim, when there came suddenly an agonising pain in his
left foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His first thought was, “I’m on a thorn,” then, “I’m
on a snake”; then, as the pain ran in a long, hot, stabbing
streamer up his leg, he knew the truth, that he had trodden
on a sting-ray. He hopped out of the water to the shore,
feeling all the blood in his foot turn to vitriol and come
surging along, as vitriol, to his heart. Most excruciating
agony made him fling himself down. He tried to hold
out his leg, but that was unendurable torment. He tried
to kneel upon it, while he put a ligature above the knee,
but the pain made him so sick that he could not bear it.
He tried to lie down, but that was unbearable. He
rolled over and over, moaning: then staggered up, and
hopped and hopped, gasping with pain, until he fell. He
had never known any pain in his life, except the bangs and
knocks of his profession, but now he tasted a full measure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although he fell, the pain did not stop, it hit him when he
was down, it grew worse. The cold, deadly, flat thing in
the sand had emptied his horn into him. He buried his
face in the sand: he dug his hands into the sand. Then
the poison seemed to swing him round and double him up.
It seemed to burn every vein and shrivel every muscle
and make every nerve a message of agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He managed to cast loose the wrapping from the foot.
The foot no longer looked like a foot, but like something
that would burst. In his deadly sickness he thought that
his foot was a pollard willow tree growing to the left of the
road. He wondered why he was not on his bicycle. He
said that his foot was dead, that it had died of the gout,
and would drop from his body and never grow again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the venom came in pain on to his abdominal muscles;
then he felt it come swimming along like little fiery rats
round the carcase of his heart. He saw his heart for a
moment or two like a black pig caught in a bog; the rats
came all round it together, from every side, they closed
in on it and bit it, bit it, bit it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he came to himself a little, he said something
about the stars being too many, altogether too many, for
the job in hand. He said that he could not pick up the
guiding lights. Then he felt that every star was a steamer’s
masthead light, and that all those myriads of steamers
were bearing down upon him without sidelights. “Their
look-out-men are all asleep,” he said, “I can’t see how they
are bearing, and I have no lights at all. I must find a
flare and burn them off.” He groped for a flare, but found
only his wet clothes pressing on his body. “The flares
are all damp,” he said, “the flares won’t burn. It is my
fault; I stored them in the pickle-house. They ought
to have been in the chart-room with the flags.” He
wandered off in his thoughts far away from the lights of
the stars. He lost all knowledge that he was lying on the
sand three or four thousand miles from home. His main
thought was that he was wandering along corridors in
search of doors. He knew that it was very important to
find doors, but whenever he found any, they closed in his
face and became parts of the walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a long time he roused himself up, feeling weak and
sick. He knew at once, from the feel of things, that it was
midnight. A sense of his position came to him. The
<span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> must have sailed: he had lost his passage:
he was miles from anywhere: he had lost Richard’s bicycle.
All these things had happened because of his dream,
because of Los Xicales. He sat up, but saw no light in
the direction of the house. Over the spit with the pine
trees there came a sort of flashing glimmer twice a minute
as the light swung round in the tower of Manola point.
He was bitterly cold, for besides being wet through, a
mizzling rain was falling on him. He was sick and wretched.
The closeness in the air was gone; a breeze was blowing
the rain straight along the beach. The trees inshore were
whistling and rustling: the seas broke as though they
were cross, with a sharp smash instead of the relenting
wash of twilight. All sorts of little life was scuttering
about the sand: white owls, or sea-birds, cruised overhead
as silently as sails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard sat up and tried his left leg. It was numb and
much swollen. He could not feel anything in it from his
mid-thigh to his toe. It had become as dead as a leg of
clay or mutton. When he dinted the flesh by pressing
on it, the dint remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a little difficulty he stood up on one leg. He then
felt for the first time that he had only one leg, that the
other would not act. He could move it, but not bend it;
when he put it on the sand, leaned on it, or tried to walk
with it, the thing ceased to be his, it neither obeyed nor
rebelled, it failed. He was so cold that he felt that he
would die. He sat for twenty minutes working to restore
his leg. He no longer felt pain in it, the pain was gone,
but it was as though the poison had burnt out the life.
In some ways he would rather have had pain than this
deadness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I am in a bad way,” he said, “for not many come
to this beach, and none in this State will wander about
looking for me. If I could only reach Los Xicales .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
However, I can’t reach Los Xicales this way: the quicksand
bars the land and I’m not going to risk another sting in
the sea. I can’t get back to Enobbio’s inn by that swamp.
But I might crawl along the beach to that man who has
the horses, Miguel, with the good heart, near the salt-pans.
He might not be very far: two kilometres. He might
take me in to the port, or at least to Los Xicales, where I
should be in time, if those fellows were trying anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was suffering much: the leech-bites in his right leg
itched like mosquito-bites, but were also hot and stinging;
his mouth had fur in it, which tasted like brown paper;
he felt that he was dying of cold. His hands, neck and
face were swollen from the bites of the midges. His blood
seemed to have changed within him to something grey
and slow. Worse than his bodily state was the thought
that he had broken his word to Captain Cary and missed
his passage; “mizzled his dick,” as Pompey Hopkins
called it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll be sailed by this time,” he thought. “Whatever
grace Captain Cary gave me, she’ll have gone by this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood up to look about him: he now realised, for the
first time, the change in the weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The northern section of the heaven was covered with
intense darkness. Over the blackness a sort of copper-coloured
wisp, like smoke, was driving at a great speed.
The blackness was lit up continually by lightning, which
burned sometimes in steady glows, sometimes in sharp
stabs of light. The wind had risen; directly Sard crossed
the sandy spit, it struck him with fury, driving sand and
fragments of shell against his face and down his neck.
The sea was not yet breaking with any violence upon the
beach. It was white as far as the eye could see, as though
the heads of every wave had been whipped off and flogged
into foam which shone as though with moonlight from the
phosphorescence. Washes of breaker burst and rushed up
the sand to Sard’s feet, like washes of fire in which all the
marvellous shells of which the beach was composed, were
lit up like jewels. Far away to the right, out at sea on the
edge of the sky, there was, as it were, a shaking wall of
white from the sea already running upon the Rip-Raps.
He could see it waver, but it never seemed to change.
There was a roller there before the last had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the norther,” Sard thought. “I hope the old
man did not wait too long for me, but got clear of the Rip-Raps
before it came on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He re-bandaged his foot, picked some stakes from among
the driftwood, to serve as walking sticks, and with the
help of these set out towards the salt-pans to borrow a horse.
He hobbled forward, dead into the teeth of the gale. The
worst thing about the gale was the cold. Far south as
it was, the wind came down directly from the northern icefields.
To Sard, who was thinly clad and wet through,
it was piercing. He stumbled along against it, keeping
his direction by the pale flame of the breakers which roared
at his side and flung their fire at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had gone about a mile, he saw the stretch of
the salt-pans like a patch of white heather away ahead,
distant he knew not how far. It might be a mile, or it
might be two miles; no man could judge distance on a
sand so flat. At anchor, under the head beyond the sand,
was a ship which had not lain there when he came to the
beach. She seemed to be a small tramp or large coaster,
sheltering from the norther. She carried no lights. Sard
judged that she had come there to load copper from the
mines of Tloatlucan. He knew that there was a pier there,
at the mouth of a river, and that the ore came by a light
railway direct to the pier from the mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hobbled on towards the whiteness of the salt-pans:
a flat road is a long road at best; against a gale it is a bad
road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly all the way a great white bird (whether an owl
or some sea-bird, he could not tell) flew above and ahead of
him. It seemed to him that this bird shone. Perhaps
the poison had upset his eyes, or perhaps his eyes never lost
the shine of the sea breaking beside him. In his shaken
state, this bird seemed like a luminous swan, guiding him
to quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the southern end of the pans he saw a shack or
stable, facing him. The seaward end of this shack was a
small adobe house, with a palm roof. The stable was
empty: there was neither ass nor dog there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard listened for half a minute, standing still, at ten
paces from the house, while he took stock. The house
was closed to the night, yet it had the look or feel of having
someone there. Perhaps an animal instinct survives in
us from the time when it was important to know if a lair
were blank or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard went no nearer; he hailed the house in Spanish,
calling on Don Miguel by name. The place was silent,
except for the flogging of the palmetto on the roof, the
scutter of crabs and gophers on the bents and the wail of
the wind across the salt-pans. Then presently something
tinkled within the house. It might have been a revolver
cartridge, or a knife coming out of a sheath, or a bottle
upon glass. Sard hailed again, saying that he came alone,
in peace, from Don Enobbio, with desire to hire a
horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time, Sard saw the shutter which covered the window
(a space a foot square near the door) move about three
inches to one side. He heard no noise, but he was watching
the shutter and saw its greyness change to blackness as
the wood moved. “I am a friend,” he called. “I come
from Don Enobbio to Don Miguel to hire a horse. I, a
sick man, wish to ride to Las Palomas if Don Miguel will
give aid, thus emulating the Good Samaritan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard the heavy iron-wood bar of the door go back
in its runners; the door opened about eighteen inches;
a young woman appeared, yawning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enrique,” she said, “Enrique, back already?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not Enrique, lady,” Sard said, “but a traveller
in need of a horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dios mio,” she said, “and I not combed! I thought
you were Enrique. Wait, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not have to wait more than a minute; a light
appeared at the shutter; a tin basin or pan was kicked
into a corner; then the door was opened, the young woman
called:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will the caballero enter, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enter,” Sard thought, “and have my throat cut,
perhaps; but I will enter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went in, with a watchful eye lest Miguel, who “erred
in mind,” should be lying in wait with a sand-bag just
behind the door. However, Miguel was not there, the
young woman was alone in the one-roomed house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had lighted a little tin lamp, which had a smoke-blackened
glass, broken at the top. By the light of this
Sard saw the room to be bare and untidy. The bed was
an array of small pine boughs, with their needles, covered
with sacks, ponchos and old serapes. The young woman
had just risen from her nest there; she was “not
combed,” as she had said, nor dressed, but hung about, as
it were, with a long undergarment torn at the shoulder.
She was a plump young woman, just beginning to grow
fat: she was very dirty: her long, black hair shone from
an unguent; she flung it rakishly back from her brow with
the gesture of a great actress. Her eyes were like mules’
eyes, black and shining, with yellow whites. Her mouth
was exceedingly good-natured. She stood near the door,
clutching her sacking to her shoulder with one hand, while
with the other she motioned Sard to enter. She grinned
at Sard as a comely woman will grin at one whose praise
of her comeliness would be esteemed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room, which was next door to the stable, had been
lived and slept in for some months with closed door and
shutter. It smelt of oil, tortillas, frijoles, horses, rats,
mice, espinillo, hair-grease, poverty, garlic, tobacco, joss-stick
and musk. A sort of mental image of a life made of
all these things, all flavoursome and with a tang to them,
reached Sard at once through his nostrils, with the further
thought that it was not such a bad life, since it left the
person both dignified and kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He explained that he needed a horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay de mi,” she exclaimed, “but Miguel is with the
horses at the siding beside the jetty, a half league hence.
Assuredly he will lend a horse, but it is further on, at the
quay, that you will find him now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go on, then,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you are wet and have known misfortune. Enter,
I pray you, and rest from your misfortune. Ay de mi,
your foot has trodden unhappily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not since it has led me to your presence,” Sard said.
“But thank you, I must not enter. I will go on to Miguel,
to the horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in his tone or bearing or look, something in
himself, seemed to impress the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly,” she said, “the good Jesu comes thus, but
must not go thus. Sit you, Sir caballero.” She brought
forward a three-legged stool, the only seat in the room, and
made him sit. “Sit you down till I see your foot,” she said.
She would have none of his protests, but had his bandage off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have met a snake,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; a sting-ray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you have been in the sea and are of the ship,
no doubt; ay de mi, all wet, all wet, what misery.” She
felt his arm and shoulder and cold hand. “And a sting-ray;
often have I seen them, with their horns. There is
a negro who can cure such with a white powder; but I
have nothing. Nothing but love which is a part of the
love of God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was kneeling at his side with his foot in her hands,
kneading the swollen flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said, “this is no time for the cure. The
poison has killed, but is now dead: the flesh is dead. It
takes a day, two days, who knows, after a sting-ray. Then,
when the life begins to return, one can help. See now, I
can, by God’s mercy, do something. I have here a stirrup
shoe made long ago, but still of use. I have but the one,
for the other was cast out in error, as I always maintain;
while others, on the contrary, think that Martin took it,
Martin the pedlar, the old soldier, who comes round with
saints and handkerchiefs. See now, a shoe for a count or
duke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She produced what had been the stirrup-shoe of a count
or duke in the days when such things were. It was a sort
of wooden-soled slipper, with a sole of wood, and heel and
toecaps of cuir-bouilli. The great silver bosses and brackets
had long since been wrenched from it. The last user had
fixed it to his leathers with wire. The design on the cuir-bouilli
was of a coat-of-arms, but eaten away by ants and
green with mould.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See now,” she said, fitting it to his foot, “a shoe for a
count or duke. You shall walk the better for it. It is a
shoe such as might have been made for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hand rested for an instant on Sard’s pocket, from
which a draggled silk handkerchief hung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dios mio,” she said, “you are count or duke. It is so
soft. This is silk of the countess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fingered it with a child’s delight in the texture. “Is
it all like this?” she said. “Truly, if you are not count or
duke, you are servant to one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s more like it,” Sard said, rising, so as to tread
upon the shoe. “I’m a servant, to a limited company.
Your shoe, señora, is as water to one dying in the desert.
You have been a friend to me in time of need. You know
the wise saying, ‘a friend to the beggars will never lack
guests.’ I say, ‘May a host to a beggar never lack
friends.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The good Jesu comes in all shapes,” she answered.
“And you are not a beggar, but very much a caballero;
oh, very, very much a duke or count. You are English.
They say that the English are as ice, and therefore come
hither to be thawed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is partly true, señora. I have been melted by
your kindness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is also said (though this I do not believe) that no
Englishman will kiss a woman to whom he has not been
married by the priest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is assuredly true, señora.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never, never, never; even if all things conspired:
the moonlight, perfumes, music, and beauty such as hers of
Sheba?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never, never, never,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay de mi,” she said. “But it is said that the English
are as Turks, and are married to very many.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are as God made us, not as people say, señora; but
we remember kindly acts forever and I shall remember you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forever?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is very caballero. But what is memory? A
thought. You have not even asked me my name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going to ask it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were going to ask it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly,” she said. “It is true, then, as they say,
that the English are as ice. ‘Assuredly.’ You said it
with a peck, as from a beak. ‘Assuredly.’ If I were to
take a dagger and thrust it into my heart so that I fell
dead, you would say ‘Assuredly she has driven the point
too far. Assuredly she is no longer alive.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so,” Sard said; “I should not say it. I might
think it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you be sorry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry for any suicide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your cold ice would not thaw one tear. But, vaya, if I
were countess, and lay dead, you would stand like marble
and say poetry. Listen: my name, the name I call myself,
is Rose of the South: will you remember that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; faith of caballero.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you remember me, who am that name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is me, myself, that name. When I was little, I had
a sister: we used to play grand ladies out in the sage brush.
She was Lily of the West; I was Rose of the South. She is
dead, pobrecita, the Lily: she was of this world, which
needs a man, not a woman: pobrecita mia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your real name?” Sard asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clara,” she said, “Clara of the Salt-Pans, the woman of
Miguel, called Miguel sin Nada.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is Miguel con Mucha, with yourself, señora,” Sard
said. “And now adios, and always my thanks, siempre,
siempre, siempre. I will return your shoe by Miguel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the love of all the saints in bliss, caballero,” she
said, “in no way let Miguel suspect that you have talked
with me. Ay de mi, we women; we suffer for our hearts.
Miguel is of a jealousy that would make proud, being such
evidence of love, if it were not such inconvenience. A
thought, a turn of the head, a look, and he at once ranks
me with those infamous of life, with her of Sheba, and
Ysabel, Queen of England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not let him suspect,” Sard said. “And now
farewell, and my thanks and again my thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay yet,” she said. “Stay yet for one instant. I
shall be here sixty years, perhaps, like Caterina La Fea,
below, at the poblacion, old, old, and wrinkled like the
devil, red-eyed, blind, from sitting in the smoke, sucking
bits of meat at last, with her gums. And little children
flinging dead rats at her and calling her Witch-Witch.
I have had one instant with you; let me have one other;
only one; since it has to last for sixty years, you would not
grudge me one instant? Then when I am as Caterina, I
shall think, ah, but truly I lived, once, at that midnight,
when one like St. Gabriel came to my door, and was as a
count or duke to me, who am Clara the woman of Miguel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Señora,” Sard said, “I, too, shall think of you, at times,
for whatever years may remain to me; but now I must go,
and so I say again, thank you and farewell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned away as fast as he could hobble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay yet,” she implored. “I do not importune, but I
do not know your name. Tell me your name. I would
think of your name and pray for you in the chapel and
before the image here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Harker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harker. What does that mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know: perhaps ‘one who listens.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listens for what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do people listen for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sea wind in the heat,” she said thoughtfully;
“and the crowing of the cock in the night of pain; and,
in life, the footstep of the beloved who never comes; or
when he does come, goes on the instant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you listen for?” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A change of wind, perhaps. Adios.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned from her rapidly, but as he turned she knelt
suddenly at his side, snatched his hand and kissed it.
“Thank you,” he said, “but men are not worthy of that,
señora.” He withdrew his hand and hobbled a few steps
away. At this little distance, he called: “I thank you,
señora; good night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that she would not follow him into the darkness:
she did not, but he heard her break into a wild crying of
tears and lamentation. The last that he saw of her was
the grey of her sacking and the pallor of her face, standing
looking after him while she lifted up her voice and wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps three-quarters of an hour after leaving Rose of
the South, when it was (as he judged) a little after two in
the morning, Sard saw in front of him the sheds of “the
siding beside the jetty.” Sard could see no horses, but
there was an engine on the line with steam up; a glow was
on the smoke coming from its funnel; a glare from its fire
made the stoker and driver ruddy with light. The engine
was headed inland with a load of trucks coupled to it.
Men were moving about between the quay and the trucks,
either loading or unloading something heavy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At any other time he might have wondered why men
were shipping copper-ore at midnight during a norther,
though indeed the jetty was screened from the wind by the
high land beyond it. He had no suspicion of these men.
He was perhaps stupid from poison and fatigue; he thought
that he had reached his rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the workers came away from the trucks to get a
drink at a scuttle-butt. Sard heard the chain of the dipper
clink, and the water splash. Then the man spat and went
slowly back to work, singing in a little low clear voice the
song about the rattlesnake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard drew nearer, to look for Miguel and the horses. He
came down on to a loop-line, crossed it, and passed between
sheds and shacks, some piles of pit props, fuel blocks and
drums of wire rope, on to the pier-head. A naphtha-flare
was burning there to give light to a gang of men who were
handing cases from a launch, which lay below the level of
the jetty, to the trucks coupled up to the engine. Even
then, Sard did not see at once what company he had come
among. One of the men, who had been watching his
advance, whistled. A man, who seemed to be in authority,
moved up swiftly and rather threateningly on the right:
two other men came up from the left: the work of the
gang stopped. The men put down the cases which they
were carrying and faced Sard in a pointed manner. Most
of them had been humming or singing to themselves as they
worked, but their singing stopped on the instant. More
than this, a voice in the launch asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the rally?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the men in front of Sard replied, without turning
his head: “Strangers in the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three heads showed over the edge of the jetty, then three
more men sprang up from the launch on to the jetty itself.
Sard found himself facing about a dozen men, with other
men closing in on each side of him. All the men were silent,
most of them were watching him intently, though some
peered into the night behind him. All the men, without
perceptible motion, had pistols in their hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop just right where you are, brother,” the man on
Sard’s right said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drop them palos and put them up.” The tone rather
than the words made Sard drop his sticks and lift his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you alone?” the man asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Move right down to the edge of the jetty. Keep your
hands up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t walk without sticks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walk him down there, two of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two of them did “walk him down” to the edge of the
jetty. Ill as Sard was, the men, their voices and their
every action, made him feel that his life hung upon a
thread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew, too late, that he had come upon a gang
of rum-runners in the act of putting their freight ashore.
There was no question of showing fight; he could only hope
that they would not shoot him in the back and leave him
to the crabs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was walked to the hard-wood blinders at the very
edge of the jetty. He saw beneath him a broadish stretch
of water reaching to the high land beyond. The river bar
was noisy at some little distance to his left. Just below
him was a scow-launch half full of cases. She was lifting
and drooping a little to the motion of the water. A deck
hand, sitting on her forward gunwale, was staring up at
him. A short, foreign-looking man, with a bush of hair
under which gold earrings shone, came out from the covered
engine-room abaft-all, and stood there, in a glow of light,
holding on by the wheel. He, too, stared up at Sard, but
went on eating an onion: he did not speak. His eyes were
intensely bright: his shirt, which was whitish, with a few
coloured stripes, seemed to shine as though it were made of
silk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard took all these things in very exactly in an instant of
time, but noticed most the man with the bright eyes who
munched the onion and stared. The deck hand who was
sitting forward pitched a folded tarpaulin over some cases
directly below Sard. He did it on the instant, with a backward
jerk of his hand. Sard knew on the instant what had
passed through the man’s mind; that it would be a pity if
his, Sard’s, corpse should break any of the good rum bottles
in falling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man in authority called out behind Sard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there are any more of you, who try to lift a finger,
over your friend goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard kept very still; everybody was very still, except
for the launchman munching his onion and the clicking back
of revolver cocks. The man in authority called out again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go through him, you two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men “went through” Sard’s pockets, not like
thieves, but like policemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he heeled?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir; he’s got a knife. He’s been in the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be in again, for keeps, if he tries any monkey-tricks.
Now, brother, answer me and no damned shinanniking.
Are you alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sailor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in hell are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been on a sting-ray and came here to get a horse
from Miguel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hell do you know of Miguel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard he had horses here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told you he had horses here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people in the poblacion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man in authority called to one of the other men:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Antonio!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, señor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard heard the man go across to the officer. They talked
together in a low tone for a minute: Sard could not hear
what they said. Presently the officer called again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, brother: turn round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard turned about into the light of the flare, to find himself
covered by half-a-dozen revolvers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know him, any of you?” the officer asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men stared at him, then gave their verdict that they
did not know him. “No, sir.” “Never seen him.”
“Never set eyes on him.” One man, who had been standing
aloof, somewhat behind the officer, came forward, to
have a nearer look. He was a man of short stature, but
enormous breadth of chest. He had a sallow face, intensely
bright black eyes, a short nose, a mouth of unusual width
slowly working upon a quid of tobacco, and both hands
thrust forward into deep waistcoat pockets, where they
rested on revolver-butts. He came forward slowly, chewing
his tobacco, with a good-humoured leer upon the world.
There was something in his slouch which was of the very
essence of the man: it was his style: his pace à lui: if the
world wished to go faster or slower, it might, for all he cared,
nothing would make him change. He came to within a
few paces of Sard, who seemed to remember that slouch
and leer, but could not place the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you know him, Doug?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winked at Sard with one eye and slouched off to the
left, to stand among the other men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your name?” the officer asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ship do you belong to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a god-dam lie,” one of the men said, “the
<span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> sailed last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you just stopper your lip?” the officer said.
“If I want your dam’ soprano in this duet, I’ll call it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it is a god-dam lie,” the man said. “She did
sail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hear what this man says?” the officer said.
“That your ship sailed last night. What have you to
say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I missed my passage,” Sard said. “I was ashore,
cycling. My bicycle was stolen: I trod upon a sting-ray
down on the beach and came hopping here to try to get a
horse, to take me to Las Palomas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a dam’ likely tale,” one of the men said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Py Chesus,” another said, “he trod upon a tam sting-ray!
Py Gott, he iss a got-tam police-spy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Less lip,” the officer said. He seemed to debate the
evidence within his mind for an instant, then he
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you in the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were you doing ashore, cycling, when your ship
was sailing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came out to see an Englishman in the house along
the beach there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What Englishman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kingsborough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he a friend of yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What brought you to him, then, when your place was
on board your ship?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard that he was threatened by a gang of rough-necks,
so I rode out to warn him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did? Did you also warn the police?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This roused a storm among the men: there were cries of
“Narker”! “Put it on him, George!” “I set he was
a spy, py Gott!” “Hay que matarle!” etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What business was it of yours, to warn the police?”
the officer said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One would do as much as that for one’s countryman,
I hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did the police undertake to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me the god-dam truth now. Whom did you see
at the police?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one. I sent word there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point, which might have been troublous but
for intervention, the Scandinavian interfered. He was a
sinister-looking man with a swollen lower lip which drooped.
This gave him permanently the look of a gargoyle. He
looked, on the whole, like a young devil just after his first
night in hell, a little bloated and battered, but thrilled by
the way Beelzebub wore his bowler. He came forward
towards the officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. O’Prien,” he said, “dis feller he wass one got-tam
police-spy. What he want de police for? What he come
putt in for? He call hisself mate of de <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>, by
Chesus. Py Chesus, I don’t pelieve one got-tam wort he
say, py Chesus. And this got-tam yarn about a got-tam
sting-ray. You see, fellers, he iss a spy. Dat’s what dis
feller is: a spy. He tell de police and get us pinched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black-eyed smiling sloucher slouched forward as
the Scandinavian warmed to his appeal. His left hand
shot out suddenly, caught him on the chest and slung him
violently backward. The motion seemed effortless, but
the strength used must have been that of a bull, for the
Scandinavian went backwards tottering for five steps and
then sat down. The other men laughed. The sloucher
grinned at the Scandinavian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come off with your folly,” he said. “Tell it to the
marines but not to the deck department.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Scandinavian rose up whimpering and rubbing the
sore place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Py Chesus, Doug,” he said, “if you wass not trunk, I
make you pay for dat. It’s your being trunk saves you,
py Chesus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I am drunk,” Douglas said, “I thank God I am
drunk. I like being drunk: it’s so cadoodle. But let’s
see this man who says he’s mate of the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>. Keep
all fast with your enquiries till I’ve had a go at him.” He
slouched up towards Sard, with his hands drooped down as
before on the revolver-butts in his waistcoat pockets. His
whole being seemed to slouch, to smile and to chew tobacco.
He seemed to be chewing a sort of cud of tobacco. He
seemed to give forth a gospel of slouching, smiling and
chewing tobacco. He stood slouched before Sard, a man
of immense strength, fearing nothing on earth and capable
of any folly and any kindness. Sard could not place him,
even yet, but the slouch was familiar; he had surely seen
that grin before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Arker, my bye,” Douglas began. Instantly a thrill
shot through Sard, for the words “my bye,” spoken in
that way, gave him a clue to the speaker. “ ’Arker, my
bye, answer my question, my bye. Who’s the captain of
the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Cary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What mark has he got on the right side of his
chin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mole; a dark brown mole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down in the cabin of the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>, what is hung on
the starboard bulkheads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing at all, except two canary cages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the name of that black cat you have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nibbins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is odd about your fiferails?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have small hand-winches on them (monkey-winches),
so that we can get a bit on anything, with two
men and a boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right enough,” Douglas said, “he belongs to
the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not in question,” the officer said. “The
questions are, what he is doing here and what he has been
doing with the police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again there might have been trouble, but for intervention.
This time the launchman interfered. He had
finished his onion and had licked his fingers and was now
on the jetty close to Sard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meesta O’Brien,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Avast heaving,” O’Brien said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meesta O’Brien.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m dealing with this man here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meesta O’Brien, I wanna know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in hell d’you want to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanna know how long we stay-a here? The capitan-a
he say-a to me be back by the six-a bell. Here it come
the six-a-bell. The whiska still in the launch-a and all a
talk-a, talk-a, talk-a and wow-wow-wow with-a the pistol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get to hell out of this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I tell you, I not get-a to hell; not for you I not
get-a hell; I get-a to hell when I like, what road I like.
But the capitan-a, he say-a to me, be along-a the side at
six-a bell. Here it come the six-a bell. And all the stuff
lie in the launch-a and you talk-a, talk-a. Why you not
get the stuff out of the launch? It six-a bell, soon seven-a
bell. I tell-a you now, I tell-a all of you. You get-a this
stuff out of the launch. Or if you not get-a this stuff out
of the launch, I tell-a you what I do. I get-a to hell out
of here: see? I go back straight away to the capitan-a.
He soon see what for, hey. He know why you talk-a,
talk-a. He want to know what-a for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut your dam’ Dago head!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You tell-a me to shut-a my head. I shut-a your head.
I got-a stiletto, good as your pistol. What for you tell-a
me to shut-a my head? Shut-a your own head. You
get-a the stuff out of the launch. Never mind you this
sick-a man, but get-a the whisk out of the launch. My
Jesu, too much-a talk-a talk-a. Get-a the launch clear,
see, or I go back to the capitan-a. I cast-a loose, I go,
see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here now, Jesus-Maria, mind yourself. I’ll clear
your launch and you too, in my own time. I’m captain in
this gang, and I’m going to be it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not capitan-a in my launch. I am. And if
you not get-a out the stuff, I not-a stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas, the sloucher, came forward again, not addressing
either Jesus-Maria or O’Brien, but the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, boys,” he said, “we’ve still got some of these
dam’ medical comforts to sling ashore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll get the stuff ashore, when we’ve finished this
enquiry,” O’Brien said. “I want to know about this man.”
He turned again to Sard. “What are you?” he asked.
“A Protestant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, thank God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men cheered Sard for this, not because they were
Protestants, but because O’Brien was not. One of the
men, who had taken no part whatever in the court of
enquiry, but had been sitting on some pit props drinking
from a bottle, now came up to Sard and shook his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shake hands,” he said, “if you’re a Protestant. You
belong to a blurry fine religion, if you’re a Protestant. I’m
not, if you understand what I mean, a Protestant myself,
if you understand what I mean, but I do believe in
crissen berrel, which is as near as the next, if you understand
what I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along, George,” Douglas said, “we’ll get this
medical comfort ashore and then we’ll have one long cool
one on the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a Protestant?” George asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, Mike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a lot of fellows going about,” George said, “if
you understand what I mean, who call themselves blurry
Buddhists. I’ll shake hands with a Protestant and I’ll
shake hands with a Mahommedan. It’s true they have a
lot of wives. I honour them for it. I’d do the same
myself if I could afford it. But these Buddhist fellows:
I want to tell you about these Buddhist fellows. All right
Mr. O’Brien, if you don’t want to listen, you can do the
other thing. These Buddhist fellows, they’re not Buddhist
fellows, if you know what I mean, they’re a secre-ciety.
That is,” he concluded, “if you understand what I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re a lot of vegetarians,” Douglas said. “But
come on, boys, and let’s get the stuff ashore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll not get-a the stuff ashore,” came from the
Italian on the launch. “The capitan-a tell-a me ‘be back
by six-a bell.’ You not clear-a the launch, so now I go.
I tell-a the capitan-a. He give-a you what-a for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The launch had been thrust clear of the jetty; she lay
two boat-lengths away, canted so that the current was
swinging her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back with that launch, you Jesus-Maria!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Italian made an obscene gesture and sent the launch
at full speed for the distant ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” one of the men said, “there you are, O’Brien;
half the cases not ashore, all because you want to hold a
private Old Bailey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m going to hold it,” O’Brien said. “This man
is a police-spy and I’m going to shoot him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll shoot him, hell,” Douglas said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not on your life,” George said, “not on your life. He
is a Protestant, if you understand what I mean. And
why is he a Protestant? Because he isn’t a low-down
vegetarian secre-ciety Buddhist. Because he isn’t a
Mahommedan. He might have been a Mahommedan.
They offered him seven wives, if you understand what I
mean, and he scorned the action. ‘No,’ he said, ‘I’m a
Protestant,’ he said, ‘to blazes with your houris,’ he said.
That’s right, isn’t it? That’s what he said. Isn’t it
what you said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, George Henderson, mind yourself now, or I’ll
put a head on you which you’ll remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll put a head on me? Who’ll put a head on me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You silly blighter, we’re not in Ireland here, we’re
talking religion at El Cobre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we’re not talking religion,” O’Brien said; “we’re
landing rum, and I’m going to see that we land it safely.
What is this man but a spy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s no spy,” Douglas said, “he’s a sailor like yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only he’s ate a damn sight less flapdoodle,” someone
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if he’s no spy, what are we going to do with
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him have Miguel and the horses and ride back to
Las Palomas as he wants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that he can leave word with the police in time to
have us headed off at the mines. To hell with him having
the horses!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He cannot in any case have the horses,” said the man
known as Antonio, “since Miguel took the horses, some
time since, by the footpath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can stay here, then, after we are gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, O’Brien, I wonder at you,” Douglas said.
“Here’s a man half dead, as you can see, from poison, and
a better fellow, I daresay, than any of us. If we leave him
here, he’ll be dead before noon, from cold and exposure.
He’s coming in the cars with us to Tloatlucan, where he
can take the branch line to Las Palomas before noon. And
meanwhile, boys,” he added, raising his voice, “here’s a man
pretty damn wet and sick; what do you say to dibs all
round to give him a dry shift? I say a pair of trousers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all said something out of the little they had.
O’Brien moved away to talk to the engine-driver. Douglas
and Antonio brought Sard the dry shift and helped him to
change. “Here’s a dry shift,” Douglas said. “And I’m
afraid they’re like a pig’s breakfast, a little of all sorts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get on board here,” O’Brien said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On board, hell,” Douglas answered. “This man’s not
shifted yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t give a pea-vren. This ain’t Delmonico’s, nor
Maggy Murphy’s. This train’s going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going, hell,” Douglas answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then; it’ll go without you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without me, hell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Brien turned from him savagely, darted forward to
the engine-driver and cursed the other hands into the cars.
Douglas winked at Sard. “Chief officer’s perk,” he said.
“All the same, we’d better hop it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nearest car to them was the last in the train, and
empty but for some tarpaulins and rolls of slickers. Douglas
helped Sard into it, hove his wet things after him, and
was starting to heave himself in, when the train started. A
man less strong in the arms would have been pitched headlong,
but Douglas clambered into the car, made a warm
corner for Sard, covered him up and sat beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ambitious swab, that terrier,” he said. “How are
you feeling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very grateful to you,” Sard said, “for without you,
things would have gone hard with me. Who are you?
Aren’t you Castleton? Weren’t you once C.P.F.?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I used to be Castleton, C.P.F. I was a year
senior to you,” Douglas said. “You wouldn’t remember
me, for that reason; but I remembered you. You see, I’ve
got a memory which can’t forget. I often wish it could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember you now, of course,” Sard said. “But
when were you on board the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how did you know about Captain Cary’s mole;
and the cat, and the monkey-winches?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three days ago I passed under the <span class='it'>Pathfinder’s</span> stern,
as I went ashore to see my girl. I saw a man with a mole
on his chin doing hygrometer at the taffrail. I knew it
must be the captain. It couldn’t have been anybody else.
The cat was fooling about on deck and the old man called
it Nibbins. As for the monkey-winches on the fiferail,
you were clearing a boat with one of them. I thought it a
dam’ fine little contrivance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how did you know about the cabin bulkheads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t. The point was that you did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you staggered me,” Sard said. “I was wondering
when you could have been on board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a dam’ easy game, being mysterious, when you’ve
anything at all to go on. Your Christian name’s Chisholm,
isn’t it? I saw you first on 2nd February, 1883. I
remember you coming on board, by the tug, when you
were a new chum. The chests were hove in on the port
lower deck and the lock of your chest was broken by that
old fool Goose-rump letting it drop off the slide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember,” Sard said. “You swore at old Goose-rump.
You sailed with him later, by the way. What
became of old Goose-rump?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He went to hell on the Barbary coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Running rum up to Entre las Montanas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be exciting work,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the finest life on earth. That dam’ terrier is an
ambitious swine, but even he can’t spoil it. I count all
my life just wasted till I began rousting rum. I’ve been at
it seven years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got a ticket, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ticket, hell. Yes, I’ve got a dam’ fine second mate’s
ticket, for which I could get four pounds a month and find
my own tobacco. Ticket, hell! Watch and watch, when
it isn’t all hands, boxing another man’s yards around.
Ticket, hell! At this job I’m pretty well my own master;
sleep when I like, get drunk when I like, and see my girl
when I like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Married, hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it a rather dangerous life? Things may have
been slack, but they’re tautening up. I hear that Colonel
Mackenzie is going to put an end to rum-running. The
penalties are severe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve a stronger combination than some think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t doubt it. The combination is strengthening
against you. Two torpedo-boats on the coast would stop
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d buy them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not with Colonel Mackenzie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d get them, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put a stick of dynamite in the crankshaft.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you go with this train of rum?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We go right up the mountains with it, till we reach
the jumping-off place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you never have trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have had a certain amount of trouble. There
was trouble on the Mesa Line one time. But trouble, hell.
You lie still and get your strength.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heya, you, Doug!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heya yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the train jolted up towards the mines, along the bank
of the river, a man came catlike towards them, from truck to
truck, from the direction of the engine. He hung on
somehow by his eyelids, and jangled as he came with hook-pots
of hot cazuela slung round his neck. From time to
time jolts of the truck spilt the hot broth on to his knees.
When this happened, he cursed in Spanish. He it was who
called Douglas from his talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cazuela,” he said. “Catch a hold. And here’s a
hook-pot for the other fella.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got any pan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mucho pan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Douglas leaned out, took the hook-pots with the care of
one well used to guarding an allowance, gave a pot to Sard,
and then salved the bread, which was supplied in yellow
hot buns split and filled with sausage and peppers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s more homelike,” Doug said. “Heave round
and eat: it will give you strength.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard did not want to eat: the thought of the hot dough
made him faint, but he sipped the broth and felt the better
for it. He was warm again, there in the shelter of the car
under the tarpaulins. With the warmth came a queer
feeling in his skin, all altered by the poisons which had
afflicted it, that the norther was going to be a bad one.
He felt too weak to look at the heaven, but he said to
Doug:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it very black to the northward?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bit dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much lightning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It has been flashing a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re in for a bad norther.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re in a norther,” Doug answered. “But we’re
running out of it. But you’d better sleep. I’ll cant these
slickers from under you, for the hands will want them.
Now, sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard was so weary that he was almost asleep while
Doug routed out the slicker rolls. He felt Doug heave a
tarpaulin over him and smelt the overpowering sweet
rum-like smell of the Lucky Hit being chewed in Doug’s
mouth; he noticed the stars going out under trails of
smoke; then the world ceased for him while the train
jolted on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He woke, or half woke, when the stopping of the train
sent all the rear trucks one after the other with a bumping
clank into the buffers of the truck in front of it. He did
not know where he was and did not much care, being as
weak and drowsy as one full of a drug. He noticed that
Doug was gone, but heard, as it were far away, Doug’s
voice saying something to someone about uncoupling the
last three trucks. In his drowse he heard men swearing at
chains which clanked: then he heard men pushing the
truck in which he was a little further down the line. He
heard their “O heave! O heave!” and “That’s got her.
There she goes!” and the sound of their feet padding
beside the rails. He heard someone say: “That’s you.
Leave them there,” and then the motion stopped and the
feet moved away. The wind seemed to have risen during
the passage from the coast, but he could not care. He was
not awake enough to care much about anything. He heard
in his drowse the noise of engines, steam was being let off, a
shunting engine went swiftly by, and above these noises
there came at intervals a dull grunting thud or stamp from
some machine or pump not far from the railway. Men
moved to and fro, and voices called, there was a noise of
running water and of wind. Afterwards, it seemed to him
that while he was at this place, wherever it was, he heard
men running. The thought came into his brain that he
was at Tloatlucan, where he would presently get a shift-train
to Las Palomas, but he felt that all that would be
presently, mañana, not then, not anything like then. He
lapsed into sleep again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his usual health, he would have been up and out
striding on foot to Las Palomas, without waiting for any
shift-train, but he was only the wreck of himself, all weak
and weary. Perhaps a salvo of guns, a blast of trumpets,
or the noise of all three masts going over the side, would
have failed to rouse him then. He slept, as sailors say,
“dead-oh.” He would not have wakened for less than a
kick in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, however, he roused again at the battering
clank of a train of trucks backing in upon the truck in
which he was lying. He roused enough to hear voices and
the clank of chain, with the thought that they were doing
something with a steam winch, he could not care what.
He drowsed off at once into the deeps of sleep into which
none but harvesters and sailors ever sink. In his sleep, he
became conscious of vibration, as though he were in a berth
above the engines in some small steamer under way. It
was soothing, or at least not unpleasant, to his mood of
feverish drowsiness, to be shaken thus, perhaps he slept
the better for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some hours he slept. Gradually, as he came to
himself, he found himself listening in his sleep for the bell,
so that he might know how much of his watch remained to
him. The bell did not strike, though he hearkened after it.
He felt cold, and was aware that sprays were hitting the
side of the deck-housecontinually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, punctually at the “one bell,” at the moment at
which he would have been called, he roused up wide awake
with the knowledge that something was very wrong indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was accustomed to turning out and being on deck
within a minute. He roused up now with one heave, weak,
stiff and aching as he was, ready for action. He came to
himself, remembering all the events of the night before, and
at once took stock of things. He was in the truck, which
was jolting along a bad line at about fifteen miles an hour.
It was daylight, yet all dim with storm. The hitting on
the truck which he had taken to be sprays on the deckhouse
was sand, pelting in from the desert. The floor of
the truck was covered with a fine layer of sand. A pelt of
sand flew over the side of the car continually. As he stood
shakily up to see where he was, the sand blew into his eyes,
hair and mouth, down his neck, into his clothes, into his
lungs. It came on a cold wind in little dry particular
pellets. Hard snow coming in a gale has a similar power of
annoying and confusing; this had a power beyond snow,
of maddening. It stung like hard snow, but after it had
stung it did not melt, it remained as grit where it had
fallen, in the clothes, the eyes or the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could see, perhaps, sixty yards to windward and a
hundred yards to leeward of his truck, which seemed to be
somewhere towards the end of a goods or freight train.
The train was going along a waterless land which was
sometimes a scrub of chaparral and mezquite and sometimes
a desert, with cactus and prickly pear. Over all this
expanse the accursed norther came down like a devil
pelting sand, never in any great volume, but in a drift
which never ceased. Sard noticed that the side of the
next truck to his had already had a kind of polish given to
it by the never-ceasing pitting of the pellets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that the “norther” being as cold as it was,
must be blowing from within three points of north. This
gave him the train’s course as roughly north-west. The
sort of glow in the sky, which marked where the sun would
be, as well as his own sense of time, always very acute,
showed him that it was about eight o’clock in the morning.
Reckoning that the train had picked up his trucks between
three and four o’clock, he judged that he had been carried
some sixty or seventy miles into the desert of Tloatlucan,
and that the next stop would be fifty miles further on, in
the foothills beyond the desert, where the railway began
its climb into the Sierra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doug and his brother smugglers had of course gone with
their freight on the other fork of the railway far to the west.
Looking about in the sand on the floor of the truck, Sard
found a hook-pot half full of cold cazuela and two of the
small loaves stuffed with sausage. He was glad of these,
in spite of their being gritty with sand. When he had
breakfasted, he felt more like himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he could neither stop the train nor get out of it he
went on with it, wondering how soon he would be able to
return. And as he wondered, he took stock of his equipment.
He was dressed in a pair of old serge trousers
belonging to Doug, a pair of slippers which had been cut
down from bluchers, an old flannel shirt, as clean and soft
as lint, a blue dungaree jacket, blackened with stains of
dried oil, plainly the gift of one of the launch-men, and a
tam-o’-shanter working-cap, wanting the topknot, which
had once belonged to a sailor in the French battleship
<span class='it'>Suffren</span>. He had his own belt and knife, an old blue
handkerchief printed with the legend “A present from
Bradford,” a paper collar, one sock and one stocking.
His own wet clothes, which he had put in the truck, were
gone. His watch, his money, penknife, key-ring and
“pocket tool chest,” a little appliance containing a marler,
screwdriver, nipper, spanner and corkscrew, were all gone.
He had put them into the pocket of the dungaree jacket,
when he had changed his clothes, but they were gone. He
had nothing but the clothes in which he stood, his sheath-knife
and a little brown pocket-case which contained a few
pulpy visiting cards, some stamps ruined by the wet, a
few matches, and three crushed xicale flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had lost his job, his passage, his clothes, his possessions,
his identity. He was being carried across the desert
into the heart of a continent. What he was to do when he
left the train, in order to get back to Las Palomas, was not
very clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all,” he said, “there will be someone at the
way-station who will let me have a passage back in a truck.
When once I am there, I can get along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The events of the night before seemed to belong to a
past life or to another man. He rose up again to take stock
of his whereabouts and to see if he could see a train-hand.
He saw the trucks forging and jolting ahead. Beyond the
trucks, both in front and behind, were the high, closed,
yellow, wooden Occidental freight-cars, marked with
capacity marks in dull red. The train lurched and jangled
along the desert in a ceaseless pelt of sand. The sand was
merciless and pitiless, a little and a little and a little. The
chaparral bowed a little to it, the cactus seemed to put
back its ears. Everything was dry with it, gritty, cracked,
burnished. The persistence of its small annoyance told on
all things. As the dropping of water wears the stone, so
the pelting of the sand wore the spirit. Sard remembered
what he had heard of these northers: how the children are
kept from school lest they should mutiny, and how men,
maddened by that insistent patting, will strike and kill.
The thought crossed his mind that if he had to walk back
along the track in that pelting, that annoyance of the tiny
hands pat-pat-patting on face and hands would be soon
unbearable. Even there, sheltered in the truck, it came
pat-pat-patting, flying like a little dry-shot over the sides,
filtering up through cracks in the bottom, and dancing
there, like grains in a spring, till they were flung away.
From time to time the dry, quiet pat-pat-patting deepened
to a noise of water, with a roaring and a swish, into which
the train joggled, lurched, jangled and clanked, and at last
seemed to tread down and over-roar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had plenty of thoughts to worry him. First of these
was disappointment that he had not seen “Her,” as he
had hoped, the night before; next to this came rage at
missing his passage; then came anxiety for that brother
and sister in Los Xicales; what had happened to them?
Lastly, from somewhere in the background of his mind,
the thought came that it might not be easy to rejoin the
<span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>. It was going to be a good deal more difficult
than he supposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, ya!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yell of “Hi, ya” was repeated from somewhere
ahead. It was a shout or hail loud enough to be heard
above the noise of the train and of the storm. It was
addressed to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood up, screening his eyes from the sand. There,
on the top of the freight-car nearest to the trucks, a train-hand
lay. He seemed annoyed at Sard’s presence. He
yelled at him and motioned to him to get out of the truck.
He was a hard-looking man with a swollen face and a kind
of vindictive energy. He lay crouched on the freight-car,
hanging on with his left hand to the iron rail on the car-roof.
In his right hand he had a long club, like a baseball club,
which had a leather wrist-thong. He shook this club at
Sard and motioned to him with it, that he should get out
of the car. He also yelled at Sard in Spanish to ask what
he was doing on the train and to tell him to get out of it.
As he seemed to be an unreasonable man, Sard smiled at
him and resumed his seat. The man crept a little nearer,
perhaps to make certain that Sard was alone, and shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have you out of it before long, my white-faced
Luterano with the pip!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you have me out of it by force, or by your sweet
persuasion?” Sard asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be something to look forward to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man crept a foot nearer, spat towards Sard (not
very successfully against the norther) and called him some
filthy names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will open your bag,” he said, “with my knife, which
is used to opening the bags of Englishmen. I will see
whether it is true that Englishmen have the tripes of cats,
as it is said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is quite true,” Sard answered. “They have. May
I ask if you are in love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will soon teach you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does your lady love in you; your appearance
or your breeding?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man champed with his teeth, bit and worried his
thumb as though he were a dog and it a bone, and as it
were jerked the worry at Sard. It is a passionate gesture
which looks more effective than it sounds. Sard smiled at
him. Sard was slightly to windward of the man and could
speak to him without effort with the certainty of being heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will get blood-poisoning,” he said, “if you bite
your thumb with those teeth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man seemed to focus into a pair of flaming eyes;
the balls of the eyes rolled upwards so as to leave nothing
but glaring yellow, then they rolled down in a frenzy. He
opened his mouth, grinned with clenched teeth, hissed like
a snake and howled like a hyæna. He spat thrice at Sard,
nodded at him, and then retreated along the freight-car
top out of sight. Sard noticed then that another train-hand
was watching him from the nearest freight-car to the rear of
him. This man did not speak, and did not meet his eyes.
When Sard looked at him the man dropped his eyelids and
seemed to be looking at the ground, but in another instant
he was watching again and making a motion that Sard
should leave the cars. Sard could not see him so clearly as he
had seen the other man, but he made out a look of shiftiness
and hardness, a mixture of prison and the boxing-ring,
yet tanned, as it were, or coloured with the fineness of
endurance. A sort of glimmer of high quality showed in
the pitiless evil mug, as in the faces of old soldiers, with
bad records, who have been through great campaigns.
Sard judged that this man was not an Occidental. There
was a look of English or American about him. Then he
did not speak nor threaten: he used neither curse nor club,
only watched. Presently he caught Sard’s eyes and undoubtedly
made the motion that Sard should leave the cars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beat it, kid,” the man cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This seemed so unreasonable that Sard paid no heed to
him: he looked the other way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beat it,” the man cried. “Pasea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard looked at him; then looked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell and Maria,” the man said, “if you ain’t got a
gall!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps in normal runs the train-hands on that freighter
foregathered for talk, drink or cards in the after-car. Perhaps
the three trucks in the middle of the train made the
journey impossible on this occasion, or it may be that Sard,
the unknown man sitting in the truck, with the look of one
able to guard himself, made them think the norther not
worth the facing. They did not attempt the journey.
The train pounded and jangled on across the desert, in the
ceaseless pelting and pitting of the sand. The train presently
reached a part of the desert where the wind for some
reason had more scope. Perhaps the line there crossed the
mouth of some great gut in the distant Sierra. The wind
suddenly rose in strength and voice, lifting the sand so that
it looked like a smoke into which the train had to butt.
“Ai, ai!” it cried, just as it cries in rigging, while the sand
came over like sprays. Sard kept well ducked down under
a tarpaulin. When he looked up from his place towards
his left, he sometimes saw the train-hand watching him.
Whenever their eyes met, the train-hand motioned to him
to leave the cars. Presently the train-hand grew weary of
such foolishness: he shouted something which Sard could
not hear, and then beat his way aft, out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard knew enough about the train-hands on these
freighters to be sure of evil from them. Hoboes had killed
so many train-hands that now the train crews always
carried clubs, which they used on any hoboes who were
unable to pay their way or to defend themselves. Sard
had no doubts about being able to defend himself, but that
evil face abaft-all made him wonder how he was to get
back across the desert to Las Palomas. How would he
fare, he wondered, if the train-hands on the returning train
were that sort of men? He realised that he was not now
Sard Harker, the mate of a crack ship, but a ragged-looking
rough-neck, dirty and unshaven, who would get “the
hoboes’ deal, a bat on the head and six months’ road-gang.”
He began to have misgivings about his future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For another two hours the train ran on across the storm.
It was running away from the storm, all the time, so that
the violence of the wind and the annoyance of the sand both
abated. Presently the sand ceased to pelt, the train ran
out into the sun, leaving behind it a cloud of sand-coloured
storm, stretching up into the heaven, where it smoked like
sulphur fumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now on both hands in a winking bright light was the
desert of the Indios Salvajes with the Sierra of the Holy
Ghost beyond. After the misery of the night and the
nuisance of the storm, the beauty of the wilderness was
overwhelming. It lay in a half-circle, stretching for ninety
miles under the spine of the Sierra. It was all shining,
vast, mysterious, lonely beyond belief, empty of any life
that was not poisonous and spined and savage. There were
patches of chaparral, a few mezquite trees, a few giant
cactuses. The most of it was empty shining sand, many-coloured,
flitting, sometimes danced over by eddies. Rocks
of violent colours rose out of it like the bones of dead beasts.
Parts of it seemed to be alive and thinking, other parts of
it seemed dead from old time, all parts of it drew Sard like a
temptation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knelt on his tarpaulin to stare at it. He had known
the desert of the sea for a good many years. There men
exist by effort and strength, pitting their worth against it
day by day. This was the desert of the land, which calls
men, not to try their worth, but to consider their nature
and their source, and to let all their effort and their strength
be absorbed in that contemplation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt power come into him from that vast expanse
which bore no life, or almost none, that was not deadly,
yet had absorbed for centuries, unshielded, the energy of
the sun in his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about midday the train, which had been running in
sight of the Sierra, passed so close under the foothills that
Sard lost sight of them. He was feeling rested and well:
his leg was still numb, but fit for use. He looked ahead
along the line. There in an opening of the foothills a
couple of miles away were the houses of a settlement.
They were adobe houses, some of them limewashed, under
a roll of foothill which bore the marks of silver-mining.
There was a white church with a red-tiled campanile pierced
in the Mission fashion for three bells. Sard could see that
there was a station here. Something made him look back
suddenly behind him. He was not in any danger, but from
his perch in the after-car the hard-faced man was watching
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beat it, kid,” the man shouted. “Beat it like hell.”
He signed to Sard to leap from the car on the desert side.
“Kid,” he cried, “this ain’t no kid glove foolishness.
You wanna beat it just like smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, Sard had heard of men shot while trying
to “beat it” from a freight-car. He did not want to beat
it, but to explain his presence and get a lift back to the
coast. Besides, with one leg numb from poison, it was not
easy to beat it while the train was moving. The train-hand
shook his head much as Pilate washed his hands; he moved
aft along the cars out of sight again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Occidental train-hand, who had promised to look
at his tripes, reappeared for an instant to make sure that he
was still there. He showed his teeth at Sard and made a
motion of cutting open a waistcoat with the upward
sweep of one hand. The train slackened speed so that
Sard could hear the clanging of the bell on the engine.
Looking out, he could see the population of the town
sauntering to the station to watch the train come to a stop.
She curved in to the platform, which had been made there
some years before for a President’s visit. Only the engine
and one car could draw to the platform at one time. On the
end of the station building the name of the place, Tlotoatin,
was painted on a plank. The train stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she stopped, Sard laid hold of the truck side to swing
himself out. At that instant, the train jerked forward and
then backwards violently, so that he was pitched down
into his truck. He was out of the train just three seconds
after the train-hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his surprise, neither of these men made any movement
towards him: they stood watching, while a squad of soldiers
followed their officers out of the rear cars. The officers
and men wore the grey uniforms and green tejada-de-burro
caps of the Nacionales. The officers plainly knew of Sard’s
presence on the train. They came straight towards him
with drawn revolvers in their hands. One of the officers
was an elderly captain, fat, pompous, slow-witted, and with
a face like a slab of something: the other was a little thin
dapper lieutenant, with legs like pipestems cased in tight
patent-leather boots to the knees. Sard knew at once
that these men were coming back to barracks after being
escort to a consignment of silver from the mines. He
saluted the officers, who did not return his salute: on the
contrary, they seemed indignant at his saluting. A couple
of soldiers covered Sard with their rifles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you?” the captain asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So. You speak Spanish. What are you doing on
the line?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A likely story, eh, lieutenant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely, my captain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know the law against trespass on the line?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, captain,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is false,” the captain answered; “since you know
Spanish, you must know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am English, and do not,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is false,” the captain answered. “You are not
English. You are French. Your cap proves it. You are
a deserter from the French ship which called here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there be any English or Scotchman here,” Sard
said, “or any American, I can prove that I am English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We desire no proof, since we need none. You were on
the line, that suffices; without papers, which clinches it.
You are arrested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better not arrest me,” Sard said; “in spite
of my clothes, I am an officer, equal in rank to yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough words,” the captain said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By many, too many words,” the lieutenant said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least,” Sard said, “you can telegraph to the British
Consul at Las Palomas about me, or send me to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not for you to prescribe our course of action,”
the captain said. “You are arrested. Your case will
have every consideration. Meanwhile, to the barracks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the barracks: march,” the lieutenant added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If he had resisted, perhaps if he had said another word,
they would have shot him and pitched him down a disused
working. Sard knew that the silver escorts were apt to
shoot to save trouble. He judged it best to submit. “They
are cross from the sandstorm,” he thought; “soon they
will have lunched; then they will listen to reason; or I
can get word to some Englishman, or to the Consul.”
Like all sailors, he had the utmost contempt for soldiers;
to be jailed by soldiers was a bitter experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guards fell in on each side of him; two men came
behind him with fixed bayonets; the officers brought up the
rear with drawn revolvers; the captain called “March!”
As they set out, the Occidental train-hand darted two steps
forward and crouched to screech some insults. He mocked,
showed his teeth and jeered at Sard, making again the
gesture of the stomach-ripper. “You get him,” he
screeched in English, “you get-a your bag cut. A te te
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ucho!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just a couple of paces beyond this screamer, the other
train-hand stood, twirling his club as though puzzled.
He was looking hard at Sard with a face made of broken
commandments: Sard expected a bat on the head from
him as he passed. He did not get it: the man dropped his
eyes as before, and spat sideways as though dismissing the
thought of Sard. They passed out of the station enclosure
to the town, which was crowded with inhabitants, who had
either come to see the train or were now coming to see “the
bandit.” Most of the citizens were mestizos or Indios.
Sard looked in vain for an American or English face. He
heard the comments passed upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An English bandit who robbed the silver train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That a white so sickly should have so much blood!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, dirty thief, to the gallows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho, Englishman, it is not so easy to rob our silver:
we are not your Africans from whom you may rob
gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Englishman, the garota: cluck-cluck!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say he killed seven before being taken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He? An Englishman? They were asleep, covered
in their blankets. He stabbed them sleeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear you, he killed seven, sleeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them kill him, then. We have enough of these
whites at our doors without Englishmen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The barracks were close to the station. The party
marched into the patio of the barrack buildings: the heavy
maruca-wood gates were closed behind them. The place
looked as dingy as a prison and as mean as a workhouse:
it smelt like a cesspool. One end of it, the men’s end,
was two storeys high and covered with scaling plaster,
the sides were one storey adobe buildings which had been
limewashed once since they were built. The left side of
the square seemed to be officers’ quarters, for it was
screened by a verandah. On the side opposite to it were
stables, kitchens, and a sort of barton where two charrucas
were housed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be imprisoned till you can give an account of
yourself,” the lieutenant said. “Take him to the cells,
you men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am perfectly ready to go to the cells,” Sard said,
“but I wish to let the English of this town know that I
am here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is not England,” the lieutenant said, “but the
Occidental Republic, where the English, the Irish, and other
accursed gringos have no voice, save when they mew like
cats for the charity of our leavings. Your presence shall
be explained to such English as may be here. The brothel-keeper
is English and the town-scavenger Irish. There is
also a Scotchman in the road-gang for murder. Such are
the places of your race among the Occidentales.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do the things most needed,” Sard answered.
“Next to begetting a new race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For half a peseta I would blow your brains out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any Occidental would do murder for half a peseta.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find, my dog, that we do justice for nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So America thinks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lieutenant whirled right round upon his heel, a
complete circle. He gurgled in his throat, thrust his
revolver-butt into his mouth and bit it, so that marks
showed upon the wood. His face turned black with rage:
he stamped with his feet so that Sard expected his little
brittle pipestems to snap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remove him to the cells,” he said, as soon as he could
speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to the cells,” Sard said. “Remember that
you have been warned that you are jailing an officer and
will be held responsible.” He turned his back upon the
lieutenant and followed a corporal through the barton to a
yard beyond. In this yard, which was fenced with a high
adobe wall, tiled at the top, were the cells. The corporal
unlocked the door of one of the cells and motioned to Sard
to enter. Sard cast a glance about the yard. He noticed
all down the western wall a line of bullet-marks about
breast-high. He had seen similar marks on walls in Santa
Barbara: they marked executions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enter, then,” the corporal said. The cell was dirty,
but the dirt was old dirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look,” Sard said, pausing at the door. “Will you,
or one of your men, send word to the engineers of the mines
that I, an Englishman, am in the cells here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At once, can you go or send at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will see that you are rewarded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send to the chief English or Scotch engineer at the chief
mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly,” the corporal said. “Meanwhile, enter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard entered and was locked in. The corporal opened the
grating in the door and said, “How am I to be rewarded
for this sending to the engineers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall be rewarded when they come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who will reward me?” the corporal asked; “will it
be yourself or the engineers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly, then,” the corporal said, “since it will be you
who will reward me, when the work is done, it must be you
who shall make it worth my while to do it. How much
then? A hundred pesetas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a penny piece,” Sard said, “till the engineers are
here. Then indeed you shall be rewarded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a very wise proverb,” the corporal said, “ ‘Paid
first never grieves.’ And yet another proverb says, ‘Will-pay
is a fine bird, but cash-down sings.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is yet another proverb,” Sard answered, “ ‘The
fed hound never hunts,’ and another still, ‘Penny-pouched
is promise-broken.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are English proverbs,” the corporal said, “and
do not concern me. Show me at least the colour of your
money, or no message will go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is another proverb,” Sard said, “which says,
‘Grudging greed gets not.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adios,” the corporal said, “grudging greed will get no
food nor drink; no message to any engineer; nor blanket
at night, if blanket be needed.” He slipped the shutter
across the grating and moved across the yard, back into
the barton, leaving Sard alone. The cell was empty of any
furniture. It measured about seven feet each way. Its
roof sloped down from about eight feet at the door to six
feet at the back. The floor was earth, the walls adobe,
the roof ceiled with plaster, European fashion, against
tarantulas. The cell was lit by the omission of one block
of adobe just under the eaves at the back. Sard could
just see out of this hole by standing on tiptoe. He saw a
patch of sandy soil which had been channelled and pitted
by people wanting sand; rats were humping about in this
among refuse tipped there from the barracks. Beyond
the sandy strip and distant about 120 yards was the
railway, with its platform, water tank, fuel heap, and the
legend</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>Tlotoatin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond this was the desert reaching to infinity, where
violet rocks gleaming with snow merged into the shimmer
of the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shutter of his door was pulled back: a private
soldier peered at him through the bars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See,” he said, “you want a message taken to an
engineer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which engineer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any English engineer. There must be some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. There is one, Mason, at Chicuna Mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you go to him? Will you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell him of me and ask him to come here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Listen. That corporal is a fool. He is put on
to ask money by the lieutenant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a greedy one, the lieutenant. But one who will
squeeze his feet will bleed his mother, as we say. And to
ask money of one whom God has afflicted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, who ask no money, shall be well rewarded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ask no reward,” the man said. “God forbid that I
should make profit from distress. One thing only I would
ask: that you would lend me your coat, so that I could
leave the barracks, since in uniform it is forbidden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly I will do that,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will pass it through the bars,” the man said,
“then I will put it on and hurry to the Chicuna Mine, so as
to be there before the whistle blows. It will blow for
dinner and siesta in a few minutes now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard knew that the siesta hour must be very near and
that the moment was propitious for the finding of a fellow-countryman.
He had only been a few minutes in prison,
but already the thought of being locked up through the
siesta when he might be outside made him anxious for
the engineer to be there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give to the engineer this card,” he said, “and urge
him hither at once; any engineer who speaks my tongue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a penalty,” the man said, “if we are caught
outside the gates in uniform.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What penalty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That of the thumbs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, in this coat,” Sard said, “you could surely pass
out unobserved?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will not catch me,” the man said; “and if they
do (though they will not), it will be well worth while, since
to help the afflicted can never be a sin. This will I always
maintain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely rightly,” Sard said, stripping off the old and oily
jacket. “But here is the disguise for you; this coat.
You had better take the cap as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard could just make out that some other soldiers were
in the yard not very far away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it safe?” he asked. “There are men there who
may see you take the coat. Will they betray you, if they
see you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never,” the man answered. “They are my brothers,
set there to watch for the corporal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take then the coat and cap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soldier cast a glance about him, to see if it were safe
to take them; then he slipped them through the bars and
under his coat. “Wait yet, one moment,” he said;
“should you desire food or drink, I would buy some, if you
would give the penny. I mention this, because otherwise
you will have neither food nor drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, I need neither food nor drink,” Sard said,
“but only the engineer, as soon as you can bring
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, Excellency,” the man said. “And now it will
be necessary that I close the shutter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right,” Sard said. “And thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man closed the shutter. “I will start straight
away,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard heard him move away to the other soldiers who were
standing in the shade of the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have the coat,” he said proudly to his comrades.
“And not only that, he said, ‘You had better take the
cap as well.’ I had asked for the coat as a disguise, thinking
it the limit that I could ask, when, lo, he himself says,
‘You had better take the cap as well.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a roar of laughter from the soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cap and coat too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and it was he himself who said, ‘You had better
take the cap as well.’ And I had not thought of the cap.
Never once should I have dreamed of it. But he himself
thrust it on me, ‘Take the cap as well, O take the cap as
well.’ ‘I beseech you,’ he said to me, ‘take the cap as
well.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a French cap, Martin,” one of the soldiers said.
“The Little Twig-Legs remarked of it, that it is a French
cap. Thus we have the Paris fashions at Tlotoatin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind” (another said) “that the French cap do not
bring within itself the French crown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Englishman is more innocent than Joseph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, Martin,” one of the men said; “did not this
Englishman offer you money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Money? Why, he has no money. I, who watched
his face, know well that he has no money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No money and no coat and no cap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay yet,” one objected. “He handed you paper, as
I myself observed. Was not that money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was this, which I was to give to an engineer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What engineer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One Mason, of the Chicuna Mine: such being the names
which came into my head. He asked, ‘Is there an English
engineer?’ ‘Truly,’ I said, following my inspiration,
‘there is Mason of the Chicuna Mine.’ ‘Give him this,
then,’ he said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not. Writing. He had several like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it English money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. The English use only gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Accursed Lutherans, and that they steal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that the writing is the symbol of a secret society
to which all these dogs belong,” one of the soldiers said.
“These symbols they pass to each other by messengers to
give warning of their accursednesses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tear it up then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meanwhile,” Martin said, “I will with this coat and
this cap to Eustaphia; madre de las putas that she is,
even she will assuredly give me one twenty-five for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are old,” a soldier objected. “She will not give
one twenty-five, but one five, or one ten, not a Portuguese
milrei more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One five or one ten. They are of European weaving
and will last for many lives. But to market.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the soldier passed Sard’s door, to market the coat and
cap, he called out, with a fair imitation of Sard’s voice and
accent:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take then the coat and cap. You had better take the
cap as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a blow, which would have been pleasanter than an
answer, was impossible, Sard kept silent, though his
thoughts were bitter. In about ten minutes, Martin
returned triumphantly. He passed close to the cell-door,
so that Sard not only heard him but smelt the fragrant
reek of the hot tamales and annis brandy, which he had
bought with the spoils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See,” he said, “she being glad with brandy gave me
one-forty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One-forty; is it possible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us, then, into our room, away from corporal and
Little Twig-Legs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay yet,” one soldier said. “Shall we not give a
tamale and a tot of brandy to this Englishman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has refused it,” Martin answered. “He refused it
with scorn, almost with insult. ‘I need neither food nor
drink,’ he said, ‘only the engineer, who is my sole passion,
now that my wife has fled with the lodger.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard would have been very glad of a tamale and a drink
of water, but neither was offered. The men moved off
and closed a door behind them. Soon after that, the
hooter-whistles blew at three different mines. A trumpeter,
taking the time from them, blew a call in the patio of the
barracks. For a few minutes Sard could hear the shuffling
of many feet, hurrying to those calls to dinner and siesta.
“No one will come to me now,” Sard said, “for three
hours. I am locked in till they choose to remember me,
and nobody who knows me knows where I am.” He tried
the door, which was locked, as well as barred across: the
upper and lower panels of it were metalled. He tried the
walls: they were made of a kind of adobe which had been
furnace-burnt: they were brick. The roof he could not
easily reach, except at the back of the cell. The floor
was of clay which had been puddled and beetled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all these four barriers, the floor seemed to him to be
the most easy to remove. He hung the handkerchief, “A
present from Bradford,” over the grating in the door, lest
some spy should pull back the shutter. When he had done
this, he knelt down close to the back of the cell, took out his
knife and began to dig bare the lowest courses of adobe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His knife had been given to him years before as a keepsake
by his second in the port main; it had been with him
in his first voyage in the <span class='it'>Venturer</span>, and ever since, in all
his sea-going. It had not been taken from him by the
soldiers, because they had not expected that any man
would carry a weapon where a sailor carries his knife.
They had tapped his side, breast and hip pockets, but not
the middle of his back. The knife was of the common type
of sailors’ sheath-knife. He had cut nicks on the handle,
a nick for every passage completed between port and port;
thirty-six nicks altogether. The sheath was not the
original sheath, but a gift from a sailor called Panther
Jack, who had made it for him in the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> out of an
old boot. The knife-blade was worn away to a thin crescent
of steel by repeated sharpenings at the grindstone. It was
as good a knife as a man might hope for in work aloft,
cutting stops or ropes’ ends, but it was the poorest kind of
trowel. In his eagerness, he put too much weight upon it
and snapped the blade across about an inch from the handle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was disheartened by this, but continued to scrape till
he discovered that the pounded clay on the floor had been
laid on a spread of pebbles set in mortar. The mortar
was queer stuff, very hard near the pebbles, but soft between
them. It took Sard one hour to clear out three pebbles.
Under the third was an iron bolt, or nail, the length and
weight of a marline-spike. It had been bent a little. In
its day it had had a good deal of battering. It was rusty,
but very well fitted to be a punch to drift out other pebbles.
Using a pebble as a mallet, Sard was making good progress
when a low voice called him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s there?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Kid, don’t make any noise, but come right up to
the hole there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard came cautiously, half expecting a missile through
the hole. He saw that the hole was blocked by a man’s
face, which so shut out the light that he could not recognise
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Kid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The face swung away from the hole, for the stone on
which the man was standing slipped a little. Sard recognised
the ugly-looking train-hand who had watched him
from the after-car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Kid,” the man repeated, as he clawed back into
position, “you wanna get quit of here, or you’ll line the
cold-meat cart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m trying to get quit,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you wanna try pretty dam’ hard. You was on
the silver line and you ain’t got any plunks, I guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you wanna get out before sundown, sport. These
silver-escort guys, they’ll keep a man till sundown, to see if
he’ll pay to be let out. If he can’t, they bring him into the
yard ‘for exercise’ and shoot him full of holes. If any
question’s asked, they say they shot him while he was trying
to escape. What the hell did you stay on the train for
till she pulled up? I gave you the flag to beat it, and you
put your dam’ hoof right on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were going to shoot me,” Sard said.
“Anyhow, I could not have jumped from the train, because
my leg is queer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell!” the man said. “You ain’t got ten plunks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, sewed away anywheres, against an emergency?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t a penny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because if you have ten plunks, you’re up against your
emergency, don’t you make any mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t a farthing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell!” the man said, “I was cleaned out at pinochle
myself, only last night, by that dam’ Dutchman. Hell!”
He climbed from his perch, readjusted his foothold and
clambered back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dam’ that Dutchman’s soul and that dam’ Las Palomas
Pilsener.” He seemed to be busy with his hands and eyes:
soon he spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Kid, you gotta get out-a here. Watch-a doing?
Digging?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the roof ceiled inside? I see it is. Hold on, then,
till I have a try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard heard him heave himself up on to the roof, where he
seemed to lie prone, working busily, with very little noise,
for ten minutes. It was still siesta time, but Sard judged
that someone in the barracks might see or hear at any
moment. Mutterings, mainly curses, came from the man
on the roof, with the scraping and raking of tiles. For all
the attempt to keep quiet, a good deal of force was being
used; soon pieces of tile went slithering down the roof
with what seemed to Sard a devilish tumult. Then the
man seemed to get a purchase on a key-tile and wrench it
this way and that, with the noise of a riveter’s yard. Sard
felt that any sleeper within a hundred yards must be roused
by the racket. Worse followed, for the tile broke; some
of it flew off into the yard and smashed upon a stone, the
rest bounced on the roof and then slithered down it and
off it: the train-hand cursed it and its parents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the soldiers, who had been sleeping in the barton,
came into the yard, looked about him, saw the man on the
roof and challenged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m mending this dam’ roof. Remediando this dam’
teja.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told you to mend the roof?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The capataz and also the teniente.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my brave, it is true. Go you and ask them if you
don’t believe me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go you and ask them, if you do not believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did not say so to me, that the roof should be
mended.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here, brother: they said so to me. Do you get
that? To me, that is me here, they dicoed that I should
mend this dam’ roof; and I’m mending it; and when it’s
ended, you can have the dam’ bits to scratch with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bueno,” the man said, after a pause. “Esta bueno.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess it is bueno,” the train-hand muttered. “It’s
pretty dam’ bueno, if you ask me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on working. Having cleared away two tiles,
his task was easier, because he could get at the pegs in the
heads of the course below them. He cracked each tile at
the peg by a smart tap, then shook it clear and piled it to
one side. Presently he wrenched a couple of laths away,
beat violently downwards with them and knocked a foot
of the ceiling into Sard’s cell. He had begun his work with
some precautions against noise: he now took none. A
second soldier came yawning out of the barton. He stood
staring with his mate at the breaking of the tiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is he doing?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mending the roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Verdad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Verdad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here now,” the train-hand said to Sard, “can you
ketch aholt of these laths and give a swig down on them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is talking to the prisoner,” the second soldier said to
his comrade. “He ought not to talk to the prisoner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly he ought not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what was I saying to the prisoner?” the train-hand
answered. “The prisoner was talking to me. He
was complaining that I broke his siesta.” He bent his head
down, as though speaking to Sard. “You say you’ll complain
at having your siesta broken; complain to the
capataz. You’ll complain hell. I’m doing my duty in
mending this roof.” Then under his breath he added in
English: “Two more swigs like that and she’ll make hell-gate
on the flood. Heave, Kid, you can git more purchase
on it than I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard could get purchase on it, by leaping up, catching at
a lath or at the plaster, and tearing it down by his weight.
The noise of the wreckage falling into the cell gave the two
soldiers some uneasiness. They looked at each other at
each fall, with comments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is making much mess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think that it is all right? What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what I ask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard no word of the mending of this roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I half think that I ought to report it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such is half my thought also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly, if aught should happen that should not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, indeed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose, then, that you acquaint the corporal .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but if all be truly well, if the roof be entitled to
this mending, then shall we be like him who, fearing the
burglar, shot the priest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it be not so entitled, on the other hand, what then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, indeed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train-hand judged that this conversation had reached
a danger-point. He started a counter-topic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My aunt hell,” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” the soldiers asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Sarah, watch the devils.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say,” the train-hand said, in an excited tone, “Pronto
now, where does this ceiling end? At each end of the
building, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but why, what has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get you within doors, then; one at each end; quick
now; take sticks. Do as I tell you; quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes; here are sticks; what are we to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Into the building, one at each end, quickly now. It is
rattlesnakes curled up here, twenty at least. Get in. I’ll
drive them down to you. There is a reward, half a peseta
a rattle. One at each end, now. And watch. I’ll drive
them down to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where shall we watch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the ventilators. Quick, quick, or they’ll be gone.
Get down and kill them as they crawl out. It will be ten
pesetas each.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men did not know where to go, but realised that they
were to be indoors, watching the ventilators. They had
picked up laths from a bundle lying against a wall. After
a half a minute of confusion, turning this way and that,
they did as they were bidden, they ran indoors, one at each
end of the building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut the doors behind you,” the train-hand cried, “or
they’ll be out into the yard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doors were slammed to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” the train-hand said to Sard, “now, Kid, hump
yourself. Get a holt of this rafter and out, pretty
P.D.Q.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard leaped to the rafter, caught it, drew himself up to
it, got an arm over it, got his head above the roof and saw
the station and the desert, both beautiful with freedom.
The train-hand gripped him by the belt and hove upon him.
With a wrestle and a struggle he got his other arm over a
rafter, then his knees; he was on the roof top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beat it, Kid, like hell,” the train-hand said. “Here’s
Twig-Legs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard just saw that someone was entering the yard from
the barton. He did not stay to see who it was, but shot
himself off the roof into the waste with one heave. He
swerved to his left under cover of the barrack wall and
“beat it” as his helper had bade. His helper hurled bits
of tile into Twig-Legs’ face, then flung himself off the roof
and “beat it” in the other direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard turned at the angle of the barracks into a sandy
street of adobe houses, some of which had white canvas
screens spread across their stoops. The street was like a
street of the dead in the siesta. A few dogs, the exact
colour of the sand, lay in the sun as though killed by a
pestilence. Sard dodged their bodies, darted down a lane
to the right, and found himself barred by a wall, which
was topped by spikes. He got hold of a spike, swung himself
up and scrambled over, into a graveyard in which the
dead seemed to be coming out of their graves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rats and dogs snarled at him as he crossed the graveyard,
the skulls looked out at him, the hands clutched at
him. He went across the graveyard and out of it, by a gap
where the wall had fallen, into a lane. He turned to his
left, ran along the lane for about fifty yards and turned
sharply to his right into a street of detached houses, some
of which had palms growing in boxes at their gates. He
walked along this street for a little way, listening for
pursuers but hearing none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must find out if they’re after that train-hand,” he
said; “I must find that train-hand and thank him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He listened intently, expecting to hear a tumult at the
barracks, but all was still there. He brushed the plaster
and tile dust from his clothes. He regretted that he had
no hat: not even “A present from Bradford,” which he
had left screening the shutter on the door of his cell. He
remembered suddenly three cases of murderers arrested
from having lost their hats at the scene of their crimes.
He remembered another case, from the time of the Terror
in Paris, of a man saved from the guillotine by having a hat
thrust suddenly upon his head, while he waited his turn in
the dusk and rain at the place of execution. When his
turn came at the end of the batch, he was judged to be
one of the spectators and passed by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m suspect without a hat,” he thought, “and I am
also guilty of train-trespass and prison-breaking. But
I’m not going to beat it from here till I know whether that
man has beaten it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to his left, walked along another sandy road of
silent adobe houses and sleeping dogs, and soon reached a
road which he recognised. Far down it, a quarter of a
mile away, on the left, was the barrack entrance, with its
flag-pole, bearing the green-grey-blue tricolour of the
Occidental Republic. Opposite Sard, as he stopped to
reconnoitre, was a pulperia, with a hoarding on its roof.
It was this hoarding which was familiar; he had noticed
it while he was being led to the barracks; it bore a legend
which he could now read, in translation:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>Palace of Pleasure.</p>
<p class='line'>Look. &nbsp;The biggest Glass in Tlotoatin. &nbsp;5<span class='it'>¢.</span></p>
<p class='line'>Beds for Knights, Artists, Travellers.</p>
<p class='line'>Beans. &nbsp;Beer. &nbsp;Wine. &nbsp;Beds.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Beans, beer and a bed,” Sard thought, “how good those
things are, and how lucky they are who can afford them.
Well is it called a palace of pleasure, if that is the kind of life
they live here. I begin to understand the phrase now:
‘he hasn’t got a bean.’ And at this time yesterday I
was mate of a crack ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a mine to the westward from him there came the
blare of a hooter, giving warning that siesta was nearly
ended. Other hooters took up the blast, till the place rang
with echoes coming back from the hills. Now from some
of the houses workers came half awake, like sailors coming
on deck, buttoning their shirts. They went slouching off
towards the mines, rubbing their eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man came yawning from the door of the Palace of
Pleasure. He had a straw-broom in one hand with which
he pretended to sweep the doorstep. Half his face was
covered with one hand as he yawned. It was the train-hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Kid,” he said, “step inside here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stepped inside and shook the man’s hand and thanked
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw, come off,” the man said, shutting the door. “Come
in here.” He led the way by a dark passage past a flight
of stairs. Sard heard the rustle of skirts and smelt scent;
looking up suddenly, he saw the heads of two women
looking over the stair-rail on the landing above. One of
them coquettishly sucked her cigarette to a glow as he
passed, so that he might see her face the better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man opened a door into a room which had a bar at
one side of it, and a long table, with benches, at the other.
The bar was closed by a grating. Two men were asleep
on the benches with their heads drooped on their outstretched
arms; they were breathing heavily from purple
faces: “Feeling their siesta doing them good,” the train-hand
called it. A third man, powerfully built, with a
mottled olive face, brass earrings and a purple neckerchief,
was sitting at the table eating with his knife. He had a
small slab of something pale upon a dish in front of him.
He shovelled flakes of this on to his knife-blade and then
shovelled them into his mouth. He was a noisy as well as
an untidy eater, being still a little in drink. He seemed
displeased at the entrance of Sard: he dug his knife-point
twice into the table, as though into someone’s body, and
he said nothing, which was unusual in a land where all at
least offer to share their food and drink with the newcomer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train-hand took Sard to the end of the table away
from the other three and sat him down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Kid,” he said, “you wanna beat it right out-a
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about you?” Sard asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you. You broke prison. You helped me to
escape. You flung a tile at the officer, and some of those
men must have recognised you, since they came in on the
train with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not lying awake any,” the man said. “I’m one of
the boys. But you ain’t. What in hell you doing here?
That’s what gets me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where you wanna get to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Las Palomas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’re you going to get?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I get a ride on a freight-car?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir. The only freight-cars from here is silver cars.
There’s not much these ’Tale guys mind, but they mind
their silver. You’d be shot, sure as hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I get a job on the train, shovelling coal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” Sard asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut the train right out of your thought,” the man said.
“The freight-cars ain’t going to be healthy to you. My mate
Antonio will remember you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then; I’ll walk along the line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell, Kid,” the man said, “it’s a hundred and seven
miles, desert all the way; and anyone seeing you on the
silver line would shoot you sure as hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What am I to do then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could get a job in the Chicuna mine, sinking the
new shaft. But I guess you’d have to stay a fortnight,
before you touched your wad: they always hold back the
first week. After that you could go in on the cars to Las
Palomas. No, you couldn’t neither. You’d have to stay
another week, or six days. They ain’t only but one train
a week. They call her the Flying Fornicator or the Hop to
Whoredom. I guess she’s about rightly christened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t wait,” Sard said, “I must start back right away.
I’ll walk it. If I can’t walk along the line, I’ll shape a
course of my own across the desert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watcha going to eat? Watcha going to drink? Kid,
you can’t do it. Besides there’s snakes in the desert. Even
the Jackarillers didn’t cross the desert from here. No, Kid;
cut it right out; and go up to the Chicuna to-morrow before
the whistle. It will be the quickest in the end. Here’s
the boss; he’ll tell you the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boss came in with a demijohn and funnel; he had
been doctoring cider with red pepper to serve as whisky
for the later drinks of the evening. He was a very tall,
fair-haired, sandy-moustached man, with a cold and evil
blue eye. He carried a gun in front as well as one in a hip
pocket. He nodded at the train-hand and cast an eye
over Sard. He was in the business which brings men much
into touch with the broken. He summed up Sard at once
as being “on his uppers,” or penniless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pitch,” the train-hand called. “ ’Low me to introduce
my friend. What did you say your name was, Kid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Harker. Mr. Pitch Hanssen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pleased to meet you,” Pitch said: he did not look it.
He put down his demijohn and funnel upon the bar, and
stood there, looking at the company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pitch,” the train-hand said, “Mr. Harker wants to get
to Las Palomas. He ain’t got too much money; so I say
he’d better put in a fortnight at the Chicuna. What do you
say, Pitch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wants to get to Las Palomas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, or the coast,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you’d better inform yourself, sir,” Pitch said.
“There’s only two ways of getting to a place; you know
that as well as I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pitch,” the train-hand said, “this gentleman’s a friend
of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he’d like to order anything,” Pitch said, “he’ll be a
friend of mine. But if he ain’t got any dough, or is the
dead-broke bum I take him to be, I’ll ask him to take a walk.
This is a place for men who can pay their way and can
afford hats. Are you going to order, Alonzo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Sard said. “I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although his leg was numb from the poison, he could
still move like an athlete. He slid from his bench to the
landlord in one motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to order you to mind how you talk to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Order me hell,” Pitch said. “You’d best order yourself
a hat, you low-down hobo. Or order yourself a shave,
while you’re at it. And now take a walk to some place
where you can buy. Get out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not pull a gun, probably his guns were not loaded,
but he poked up his left at Sard’s face as Sard had expected
he would. Sard on the instant cross-countered with his
right to the point. Pitch slithered sideways along the bar,
fell, rolled over on the floor and lay quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carai!” screamed the man with brass earrings, “Hijo
de la gran puta. You dog-assassin of English!” He flung
his knife at Sard with the backward flick from the wrist
which “takes a year to learn,” so the bad men say. Had
he flung the knife before screaming, Sard would have had
the point through his throat, but the scream warned him;
he had time to dodge. The knife stuck in the bar. Sard
pulled it out. The two men at the table woke up. “Rough
house,” one of them said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut out your dam’ row and let us sleep,” the other
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carai, carai, carai,” cried the man with brass earrings.
“I’ll give you dog-assassin with the bottle.” He came
across the table at Sard with a bottle, knocking over one
of the sleepers as well as a bench. Floundering in this
wreck, he himself fell, cursing. There came a scurry of
swift yet heavy steps on the floor above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beat it, Kid,” the train-hand cried to Sard. “Here’s
the missus.” He held the door open for Sard, who slipped
through it to the front door, which was already open. He
was moving swiftly, but had a glimpse as he fled of a
monstrous woman, with an inflamed and frowsy face, who
was floundering downstairs to him, calling him to stop.
Something cracked the woodwork of the door to his left and
something banged to his right: the woman was shooting
at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached the street, turned sharply, ran round the
house, scrambled over a low wall into an enclosure, and ran
along it, while the pursuit grew loud behind him. At the end
of the enclosure there was a wall, which he climbed. As he
climbed it, there came cries of “There he is!” and bullets
struck the wall and the earth beneath it. He dropped into
a second enclosure. At the end of the enclosure there was
a house, at the door of which a man lay in a chair taking his
siesta with a gun upon his knees. The man woke up as
Sard reached him, and at the same instant the pursuers
reached the enclosure wall and opened fire. Sard slipped
past the man in the chair into the house. He said, “Excuse
me,” as he passed, and slammed the door behind him. There
was a door on his left; a woman opened it, asking him, in
Spanish, what was the matter. He said, “It is the washing,
Madam,” and slipped past her and up the flight of stairs.
On the upper floor were three children, who screamed when
they saw him. He called out to them, in Spanish, that their
mother was bringing them some sweets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried a door, which was locked, and another door,
which opened into a shuttered room; he then ran up the
next floor. There was a door opposite the top of the stairs.
He opened it, and found a young man lying on the bed,
taking his siesta. The young man’s slouch hat was on the
floor; Sard picked it up and put it on. There was no
sash to the window of that room, but closed, green, jalousied
shutters. He unhooked them, took a hurried look out, and
found to his great joy that there was a fire-escape. He
went down it, hand over hand, and reached the ground as
the young man looked out, and asked him what in the
blazes he was doing. He did not stop to answer, for he was
collared, on the instant, by the man who had been sleeping
in the chair. Sard back-heeled him, sent him flying and
reached the garden gate, just as the woman and the three
children came out of the door with a couple of dogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got out of the garden gate with the dogs at his heels,
and ran along the road, hearing the pursuit increase, as the
men from the Palace of Pleasure joined in. He turned to
his right, then sharp to his left, then again to his right, the
dogs following him and joined now by three or four pariahs,
which had been sleeping in the sand. The last turn that he
made was into a blind alley. There was a wall at the end
of it, overhung with trees. He leapt for a branch, but the
branch broke in his hand, and he came down into the midst
of the dogs. He sent them flying with a few blows, scrambled
up the wall and down on to the other side. On the other
side there was a woman sitting in a rocking-chair, knitting.
“For the land’s sake,” she said, “for the land’s sake,
young man, this ain’t no right of way. Go back the way
you came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going back,” he said, and ran on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“George! George!” the woman cried, “get your gun
quick; there’s a rough-neck come through the garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somebody inside the house answered, “What’s that you
say, Anna?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard called to the man, “There’s a rough-neck murdered
Mr. Davis; I’ve got to break it to the widow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop him, George,” the woman said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man tried to stop him, and got one on the jaw which
he remembered for a long time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard got out into a road which led quite clear of the
houses into the wilderness of the foothills. There was a
sort of trail leading up the hill, through a sparsely-grown
jungle of brushwood. He took his chance of snakes and
dodged into the brush and zigzagged through it, keeping
uphill all the time. At the top of the cañon, half a mile
from the town, he stopped for a moment, but he heard
people as well as dogs, so he set off downhill into a gully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the foot of the gully there were great rocks among
which a little river ran. He ran upstream in the water
for about a hundred yards, so as to puzzle the dogs, and
then scrambled out of the water up a great rock. At the
top of the rock there was a recess filled with dry sand and
screened by boulders. In the sand were the fresh footprints
of a wild cat, but Sard judged that wild cats are less dangerous
than men, and flung himself down to get his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a couple of minutes he heard the dogs at the water,
and the voices of men, encouraging the dogs to hunt. He
judged that there were at least eight men up with the
hounds, and others joined them. He could hear their
conversation as they walked up and down, and poked among
the rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s the silver bandit who broke gaol at the barracks
this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another said, “He nearly killed Hanssen at the Palace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another said, “Mother Hanssen reckon she hit him with
one of her shots; leastways there was blood under that
wall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another said, “He took to the water all right, but these
dogs don’t seem to get the scent any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another said, “Well, he must have gone upstream,
because if he’d gone downstream, they would have got
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another said, “He can’t have much breath left in him,
the clip he has been going. Like as not he’s got in among
these rocks here; maybe he’s listening all the time we’re
talking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another said, “The hell he ain’t got much breath! He
goes over the darned ground like a darned cyclone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another said, “Come, Peppy; come, Toto; I’ll just
take this couple of dogs up along this further bank, and you
get on upstream and see if we can’t pick up where he’s
landed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice came from amongst the bushes: “Say, boys,
did you get him yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said, “No, we ain’t got him yet, but we guess we’re
going to get him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I’m going to get him too,” the voice said. “He
come into my room, when I was having a lay down, and
sneaked my hat right off of my pillow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, come on,” said another, “and we’ll get him and
the hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went splashing up the stream, and then presently
all the dogs burst into a frenzy of barking. He heard cries
of “They’re on to him! Come on, boys, they’re on to
him; he can’t only be but a little ways ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard heard the hunt pass upstream and gradually grow
fainter towards the head of the gully. He lay still for
about half an hour. He heard some shouts and presently
the footsteps of men returning, some distance up the stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very odd where he’s got away to,” one of them said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another said, “It’s my belief he never got away, but just
lay quiet somewheres. Back in town is the place to look
for him, if you ask me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another said, “That’s right. You know that time the
dogs went on like they was crazy; it’s my belief they was
on a panther, not on a man at all. It was somewheres
around here we lost him, and it’s somewhere around here
we’d find him again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the scent’s cold now,” another said; “and not
only that, the dogs has forgotten what he smelled like.
Besides, the trail’s been all trodden out. We’d best get
back to town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I ain’t going back to town,” said the young man,
“not without my hat I ain’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” another said, “no one seems to me to be able
to describe the fellow. You saw him, kid; what was he
like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t only half awake,” the boy said. “He was a
great big fellow, an ugly fellow, and Pop says he was a big
fellow; and he ain’t got no coat, only just pants and a
shirt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man said, “Well, kid, even if he were to spring up
right among us now, I guess you couldn’t say it was him.
Maybe he’s gone downstream after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I guess I’m going to get my hat,” the boy said;
“no cheap skate ain’t going to pinch my hat and get away
with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right, kid,” said a man, “you get him, and when
you get him, soak him good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved away downstream all together, beating
with their sticks as they went, to scare the snakes. Presently
they were out of earshot, down the stream. Sard lay very
still, waiting for darkness. He heard the hooters from the
mines blowing for six o’clock. The light by this time was
going from the river-bed, but from where he lay he could
see the brush shining in the sun at the top of the cañon.
He was very weary of lying still. He said to himself,
“They’ve gone, it’ll be safe to move, I might be starting
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was on the very point of rising from where he lay,
when a rifle was suddenly fired, not twenty yards from him,
on the other side of the river. It was a repeating rifle,
followed by a second shot an instant later. He heard
something snarl, and a man’s voice cried, “Got you, you
son of a gun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another voice said, “Well, was she a painter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other said, “No, a wild cat, and she’s got her nest
hereabouts. Maybe we could find the kittens. She’s got
her nest somewhere among them rocks, the other side
of the water. I see’d her little tracks, where she’s hopped
from stone to stone, so as not to get her feet wet. See
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s she carrying?” said one of the men. “Is it a
rabbit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not it; it’s a woodchuck, I guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure she’s dead,” said one man. “I’ve known
’em to play dead, so as to get a bit of their own back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s dead,” said the other. “See here. Pretty
poor, too; skin’s no good, but I guess I’ll take her along.
If we’d got dogs, we’d have them kittens out. See here,
the tracks lead this way. Here’s the place she crossed.
My, that’s a pretty good lep! But where did she go, after
this? That darned bunch this afternoon have trodden out
all the signs. She’s gone somewhere up them rocks, and
it’s in among there, most likely. If you’ll give me a leg up,
I’ll go up and have a look round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on a minute,” said the other; “it ain’t too light
down here. I guess I’m not going to poke around in any
cavern when this cat’s mate may be about. The toms are
as bad as the shes, and if it’s up there laying for us, I’d
guess we should know it. We’ll come around in the
morning and bring a couple of dogs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now come on, man,” said the other; “the tom’ll have
hidden the kittens to-morrow morning. Finish the job,
now we’re at it. Give me a leg up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I won’t,” said the other. “These cats blinded
old ’Lije Goldschmidt. He went after ’em into a place
where he couldn’t see, and they fair tore his face off him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funk!” said the other man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I am a funk,” said his friend; “but I don’t
want to sit at any street corner holding a tin pan for
pennies, the way old ’Lije done, for the rest of my days.
But I’ll come along to-morrow morning, and I’ll bring a
shot-gun, which is a sight more use than the thing you’re
using.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you don’t care to come,” said the other man,
“I’ll do it alone. You take my rifle and hand it up to me
when I’m up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” his friend said, “I ain’t going to be a party to no
such foolishness. If you want to get your eyes clawed out,
you can. Even if you got your rifle up there, you couldn’t
see to shoot. It’s just darned foolishness, and I’m not
going to stand for it. We’ve got the she, after waiting long
enough, and the whistle’s been gone this half-hour. Take
what we’ve got and come on, and we’ll come again in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other man growled a little at his friend, but, at last,
picked up the dead cat and turned homewards up the gully.
They stopped every now and then to complain of the steepness
of the climb, then their voices ceased to sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was fast falling dark and the stars were already bright
above the gully. Sard cautiously rose, wondering whether
the cat’s mate were thereabouts. He was very stiff from
lying still. It was cold down there among the rocks and
he was faint from want of food. He scrambled down to
the water and drank. After groping about for a little
while, he found the woodchuck, which he brought along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He scrambled up the cañon on the side away from the
town. It was very steep, the scrub was full of prickles.
Presently he reached the top and saw a wilderness of
scrubby foothills stretching away for miles, as it seemed,
into the Sierra. Behind him, whenever he turned, he could
see the lights of the town, and hear the dull thumping of
the machinery and the noise of the band playing in the
Plaza. On his right was a vast sea of ghostly paleness
stretching away for hundreds of miles into the sky, where
crimson faded into a kind of green. In the green, here and
there, the tops of mountains made jagged marks. The
stars were bright in the heaven. He looked up to the eastward
stars, with the thought that by rights he should be in
his ship, watching these stars, four degrees to the eastward
from where he was. He realised that there was no reaching
the coast by the railway line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go eastwards,” he said. “Among these foothills
there must be some trail by which I can reach the coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had seven matches remaining to him. By the help
of two of these he contrived a little fire, at which he cooked
the woodchuck, by toasting collops of it upon skewers. It
was not as juicy as rabbit, nor so rank as ferret, but something
between the two. He saved some of it for breakfast
next morning. Then taking his bearings from the stars he
set out to walk to the coast. He knew the trend of the
coast from the charts; it was all in his favour. If Las
Palomas were one hundred and seven miles from him, he
reckoned that he might reach the port of San Agostino in
ninety miles. He judged that he might do it in four days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of two hours of walking, he entered a sheltered
valley in a high state of cultivation. He burst through
bushes into a track, which led, presently, to a settlement,
where the people were already asleep. He could see the
little grey-tiled houses scattered, at intervals, among
orchards. Dogs barked at his approach. The smell of
oranges came to him on a warm breath of wind. He found
himself walking between two orange fields. He could see
great globes of the fruit among the dark and shining leaves.
Some oranges had fallen and lay beneath the trees. He
took some and ate them, skin and all, as he walked. At
the end of the village or community, the fruit was thicker
on the trees, and he was planning to step into one of the
orchards to take some oranges when two men with guns
stepped from underneath the trees, and called to him to
stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing here?” they said. One was a
European fruit-farmer, the other a native servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m walking through,” said Sard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walking through? Where to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“San Agostino.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the coast,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the coast? How do you expect to make the coast
from here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walk there,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walk? Hell!” said the farmer, “you’ve come along
orange-pinching. You walk to hell clean out of here, or
you’ll get lead into you so mighty darned quick, that you’ll
think a cyclone’s struck you. Now get out, and don’t stop
to pick no flowers till you’re past the end of my plantation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard walked on along the trail; the two men followed him
at a distance of about a dozen yards, until he was clear of
the plantation. The trail led on uphill out of the valley.
It seemed to go on interminably, winding up the foothills,
but remaining a track, apparently a good deal used. At
about eleven o’clock that night the track swerved to the left
towards a northern valley, which Sard judged to be useless
to him. A sort of track or trail led on in his direction.
Though he did not know it, the track was one made in the
course of centuries by animals going to drink at the brook
below. He followed it for about half an hour and then came
out on a lonely hillside, from which he could see no sign of
human habitation except the glare in the sky above the
mining town, now many miles away. He could see little
but mountains, most of them covered either with scrub or
with pine trees. A kind of ghostly glimmer stood out into
the sky in front, from those peaks of the Sierra which ran
into the snow. In the sandy soil among the sage brush all
round him there were little scurryings and squeakings from
the gophers. Far away, he could not tell how far, it might
have been miles away, he heard the howling of solitary
wolves, a noise more uncanny than the crying of owls and
more melancholy than lamentation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>High up there, in the foothills, the wind never ceased.
It stirred the sage brush continually so that the whole hillside
seemed filled with footsteps and the noise of people
pushing through the brush. He could go no further for
that night, but scooped himself a place in the sand in a
sheltered nook of the hill, out of the wind. There he
covered himself up and slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through the next day he held on across the foothills
through the sparse-growing sage. He was already in the
wilderness, for the hills were waterless even so soon after the
rains. He saw no sign of man all through that day, except
once, when he had a view of the desert far below with a
train, trailing under smoke, going to the west. As he was
still fresh, he resolved to march without food this day: this
resolve he kept. He found no water anywhere until
towards the evening, when he struck an animal trail which
led him to a dripping rock. In the pan of water below the
rock the carrion of a wolf lay. He stayed at the rock to
catch the drippings till his thirst was assuaged: then feeling
like a new man, he went on till he could go no further. This
was a good day compared with what followed. He made
good some twenty miles of his course. He slept on the
ground where he stopped; but slept ill owing to annoyance
from the ticks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some hours he rose up as a sailor will, knowing that
his watch was at an end. It was about a quarter to four.
He felt uneasy, and sitting up in his shelter, he heard horsemen
close to him. He heard the muttering of voices and
horses wrenching at the brush. After listening intently,
he decided that what he heard was neither men nor horses,
but some other thing, he could not tell what. He remembered
now that some six weeks before, on board the
<span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>, he had talked with an Occidental, who had come
on board on ship’s business, about these very mountainous
tracks in which he was wandering. He remembered that
the man had said, “No one goes there, even to prospect for
metals. They are bad places where bad things happen.”
He remembered, too, stray bits of talk or of reading about
these mountains, how nobody really knew them, except a
body of men known as the Jacarillos, a tribe of most savage
desert Indians, to whom all the most savage of the native
bandits fled. These men, alone, were supposed to live in
the Sierra, and when Sard sat up in the cold morning,
hearing that muttering all around him in the dark, he
judged that a war-party of the Jacarillos was passing that
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he thought that that could not be so, because no
frontiersman, and certainly no desert Indian, would speak
when on a war-party, except by signs. There was something
there that he did not understand. He crept very
cautiously towards the noise, and presently was able to
peer between boulders, at the hillside whence the noise came.
It was not perfect darkness; he could see an open space
where the brush was low. In this space, moving about
exactly as though they had dropped something, which they
were trying to pick up or hoping to find, were some gigantic
men. One of them was standing not far from him. He
was not very tall, less tall, perhaps, than Sard himself, but
in bulk and bigness like a gorilla. They were going slowly
over the ground in a suspicious way, muttering to each
other. They were uneasy about something for which they
were looking. Sard felt that they knew that he was there,
and that they were looking for him. Then he felt that
though they were men, they wanted some of the senses of
men; they were like some race of men born blind, who
felt for their enemies by some sense which men no longer
have. They went very slowly over the ground across
which he had certainly passed some hours before. They
seemed to feel the ground and lift samples of it, then they
muttered remarks about the samples. One of them, away
to the right, the one furthest from Sard, seemed to be the
captain. When this man reached the point where Sard had
stumbled on his way to his lair, he paused and felt the
ground and gave a little cry, at which all the others hurried
to him. Sard could hear their mutterings and a discussion
going on among them. Evidently they had come upon his
trail and were puzzled about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few moments the thought of dealing with a race of
giants was unnerving. He saw how such a race could live
in that land in the great caves of the limestone, coming out
only at night into the wilder places of the hills, taking their
prey and going back before dawn. Then he thought,
“They cannot be men, they must be bears. But if they are
bears, it won’t be any better. They can only be grizzly
bears who attack any man on sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept still as a mouse for half an hour, while the bears
loitered about and muttered among themselves and rummaged
in the earth and seemed to find food, though he
couldn’t think what. One of them came lumbering quite
close to where he crouched. He saw him stand and look up
at the stars, in an attitude exactly like that of one of the
seamen in the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>, at the wheel. While he was
standing thus, he seemed to be conscious of some scent that
was not usual. Sard could see his head tip up and down in
an attempt to get the stray wafts, to give some certain
evidence, one way or the other. He moved away a little
and repeated the process, and then moved back, moving
with his head exactly like a questing hound and peering
sometimes in Sard’s direction, yet not seeing him. At last
he seemed to be satisfied, and went shambling off to his
fellows. They moved off into the thickets and he saw them
no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he felt that they were out of earshot and smell of
him, he turned his back upon that place and went on
through the scrub up a hill that went up and up, yet never
came to any summit. He must have walked for about two
hours when he stopped suddenly, hearing a woman singing.
It sounded like an Indian woman with a very sweet voice,
singing one of the tuneless Indian songs. A little listening
showed him that it was not a woman, but a little hidden
spring of water, gurgling from a pipe to a trough. The air
came with a waft of sweetness upon his face, as of azaleas
in blossom and oranges in fruit growing together in a thicket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said, “There’s a house here.” He called aloud in
Spanish, “Is anybody there? I am a friend. Is anybody
there?” In front of him he could see this thicket, which
smelled so sweet, all starred either with blossoms or with
fruits. He knew from the look and feel of the place that
it had been made by good people and was good, and that
the people were there, watching him, to see what he would do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not armed,” he said. “I am an English sailor
going to the coast. Don’t turn your dogs at me, but let
me have shelter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody answered, but he felt quite certain that the
thicket was full of people looking at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said, “Don’t shoot. You see I put my hands up.
I am alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went forward to the thicket and there saw that there
was no one, only a profusion of creeping flowers that looked
at him like eyes, out of the darkness of the hedge. It must
have been years since anybody had lived there. The hedge,
which had been planted, had gone back to jungle. He
walked round it till he came to what had been the gate.
There he could see within a little ruined chapel with one
bell. As he came through the gateway in the first of the
dusk, a bird, perhaps an owl, which had been perched
beneath the bell, flew out with a cry. Her wings struck
the bell, which jangled a little. It was exactly as though
Sard had rung the door-bell. He drew his breath and
stood still in the court, wondering who would answer
the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was still not more than twilight, but birds were stirring
in the scrub, and colours could be seen. Some blue birds
with orange breasts came wavering down among the bushes,
tore a few petals apart, from wantonness, and flew on,
talking to each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard stepped across the courtyard and looked in at the
deserted chapel’s western door. It must have been built
very soon after the Conquest. It had been deserted for
perhaps half a century, which in that dry climate had not
been enough to destroy it. The roof had gone, except over
the altar. From the wall-plate of the falling roof great
strings of flowers hung. Many flowers and grasses had
sprouted among the stones. Just over the altar a bough
had thrust through the wall, and had blossomed there
with a white clustered blossom which smelled sweeter
than honeycomb. The wall above the altar had once
been painted in fresco. Most of the paintings were
now gone, but Sard saw, as it were, the heads of men,
eagerly looking upward. To right and to left of the
door within the enclosure there were marks in the earth
which showed where the mission huts had once stood.
But monks, converts, mission, and the very memory of
their dealings were utterly gone. Sard might well have
been the first man to have stood there, since the mission
ended. It ended in pestilence, he thought; nobody was
left alive here for the mission to save. He judged that the
pestilence which had destroyed the mission might still be
there, in the air, the earth, the water. Yet the place seemed
good, it was unvisited, it seemed sheltered, and there were
no scorpions nor snakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lay down in the shelter of the altar, and instantly fell
asleep. He had not slept long before he became aware that
somebody was calling him by name from infinitely far away,
in a voice which was familiar and yet strange. The voice
called, “Harker! Sard Harker! Sard!” from a distance
so great that it seemed like another continent. He knew,
in his sleep, that the voice wanted him to wake. He woke
and sat up and found it still twilight there in the chapel,
with the stars not yet gone from the hole in the roof. No
one was calling, the blue birds were back again, tearing the
blossoms, no call had disturbed them. He thought, “I
wonder whose voice that was. I seem to know the voice”;
and while he wondered, he fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his sleep he saw the owner of the voice, a boy called
Peter Maxwell, who had been dead eleven years. He saw
Peter, not as he had ever known him, but eager, like the
faces in the fresco. He knew that Peter had some message
for him, yet could not say it, having no longer any human
tongue or any use for human thought. He saw Peter leaning
out of the altar wall from the place where the branch was
blossoming. Peter was stretching out his right hand to him,
but what he wanted he could not tell. He cried out,
“Peter, old man, is that you?” and in his gladness at
seeing Peter so near, he woke up and saw the blossoming
branch shaking, as though someone had brushed it by. It
was daylight but not sunlight as he rose up. No one was
there, no one had been there; the birds were still tearing
the blossoms, uttering little cries. No man could have
been within a mile of them, probably no human being was
within ten miles, and yet he expected to see Peter Maxwell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peter,” he said, “Peter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he saw that there was no Peter, he thought, “That
was a strange dream. Peter Maxwell has been dead since
1886. He died of yellow fever in the <span class='it'>Cliomene</span>. Yet that
was Peter in my dream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked round the little enclosure. There was nothing
to alarm him, except the sense that he was more alone than
he had ever been in his life. He was weary from his tramp
and his hard day. He returned to the chapel and presently
slept again. This time he slept for some hours, but towards
noon, at about the time when his watch would be drawing
to an end, he was aware that a trumpet was being blown
and that armed figures were there, wanting him to go.
With a little effort he cleared his eyes, so that he could
see these figures. There were three: two women and a
man. The man was standing between the women and
raised above them. He was standing on the altar blowing
a blast upon the trumpet, and the notes of the trumpet came
out like flames, so that Sard could see them as well as hear
them. The women were looking at him with faces so calm
that they could not have been mortal, yet when they saw
that he saw them, their faces became alive and incredibly
eager. They both turned to him and bent to raise him,
and with their free hands they pointed at the trumpeter,
who shone in all his being and pointed the way to go, and
blew upon his trumpet a blast like a cock-crow: “Get you
gone out of here, get you gone out of here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his dream Sard called to the trumpeter: “What is it,
Peter, what is it? What is it, you great spirits?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the women faded from him, Peter faded from him
into the wall, but he could still see the shining trumpet and
notes like flakes of fire failing all around him. The trumpet
dwindled slowly and resolved itself into the blossoming
branch that had grown through a crack in the wall. The
figures were gone, the fiery notes had vanished, only as
Sard stood up he smelled very faintly a smell of burning.
He walked to the altar and felt along the wall. It was a
wall of perishing plaster. No one had been there. He
went out into the enclosure, and as he passed through the
door, he smelled again the smell of burning. “Get you
gone out of here,” he repeated. “Get you gone out of here!
What is that smell of burning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once long before, far out at sea in the Pacific, he had
smelled a smell of burning during the night-watch and had
reported it to his mate. The mate said, “Yes, you often
smell that here, at this season of the year. They are burning
the scrub on the mountains four hundred miles away.”
He thought of that remark now. Looking out of the
enclosure at the thickets beyond, he saw a faint trail
of smoke curling among some dwarf oaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe this scrub’s on fire,” he said. “I’d better get
me gone out of here, or I’ll be burnt like a rat in a trap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As near as he could judge, the wind was blowing from the
north-west, and his course was to the east of north. If the
scrub were on fire, as he supposed, he would have to get
across its path. He left the enclosure of the ruined chapel
and set off further up the hill to a clear space among the
scrub, where he could see. The foothill on which he stood
looked like a moraine across the track of some ancient
glacier. From the top of it he could look right up the
valley down which the glacier may once have flowed. The
wind was blowing straight down this valley, driving a line
of fire behind a wall of smoke, which was beaten down below
the tops of the dwarf oaks. Suckers and snakes of flame
ran out along the sides of the valley and over its summit.
From time to time these suckers seemed to die out, but
others always leaped up in front of them. It was advancing
in a ragged line, coming pretty fast, with a crackling, hissing,
sighing noise that sounded very terrible. Sard judged that
it might be, at the furthest, a mile from him. It died down
and glittered up like a living thing. At that distance it did
not look like a raging fire, but it was laying all things dead
behind it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard could not see how far it stretched on the side towards
which he was going, but he judged that he would have to
hurry to get round it, so he set off at his best pace along the
ridge of what might have been the moraine. As he went
along, the air thickened with intensely bitter smoke from
the burnt bush. Little floating fiery particles came flying
past and settled on his clothes. Every now and then some
streamer of flame would blow down on something dry, set it
on fire and blow out. He ran for about ten minutes, mostly
uphill, and he reached the top of that side of the valley to
which he ran. He found that on the other side of the hill
the ground tipped very sharply down into a rocky chasm.
Beyond this rocky chasm, which contained water, was a
hillside covered with scrub, blazing like the Day of Judgment.
There was no possibility of getting round the fire.
He was shut in on that side, and he hadn’t time to get back.
His only chance was to get down to the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a place where the crag had fallen in a scree of
big pieces of stone. He scrambled down this towards the
water, but the scrub burning on the other side of the stream
was so bright and hot that he had to cover his eyes as he
slithered down. Quite close to the lip of the water there was
a big shelving stone, worn smooth by floods. It was so hot
from the blaze that he could hardly bear his hand upon it.
He slithered into the water from it, just as a flame seized the
scrub upon the opposite bank, and scorched it into nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a minute the fury of the fire had passed, and it was
running up the hillside away from him, leaving a blackened
earth, covered with glowing stalks, which hissed and sighed.
It went on, he could see it running up the hill, licking down
the scrub and leaving blackness. The wind blew over the
burnt tract, bringing soft ash, little fiery particles, and a
breath as from a furnace door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard clambered out of the water, which was brackish and
quite unfit to drink, and set off upon his course again. He
walked, like Satan, on the burning marl, in a desert which
had been grim before, but was now terrible. He followed
along the course of the chasm for half a mile, and came out
above on to a sort of tableland of rock, where the fire had
ceased. He paused here to take his bearings, and noticed,
for the first time, that a house or hut had been destroyed by
the fire, close to where he stood. It must have been almost
the last thing burned; so he went to it, thinking that
perhaps somebody had been burnt in it. On a sort of shelf
at one end of it was a skeleton of a man, gripping a crucifix.
It might have been there fifty years. The only other remains
were a couple of earthenware ollas of a good size.
These were Indian pots of a dull yellow colour, with decorations
of black and red. One of them had a thong about
its mouth, and had been used as a waterbucket; the other,
which was still covered with its earthenware lid, contained
parched corn, shrivelled to the dryness and toughness of
split peas, but still food. There was nothing to show what
the man had been. He was tall for an Indian; the crucifix
seemed against his being a miner or prospector. He may
have been some hermit, or contemplative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard removed the ollas into the open. After a little
search he found the spring where the hermit had got his
drinking water. He made a fire and cooked what was left
of the woodchuck with the parched corn, and took his
bearings while the meal was cooking. In front of him the
path of the fire still ran on along the valley. It was already
far away, running in little bright flickers of flame, under
driven-down smoke. To his left, on the line of his course,
there was a mile of scrubless desert of sand and rock,
without even a cactus or a prickly pear, stretching to the
rocky bulk of the Sierra. By the Sierra, in the direction
in which he wished to go, was a chasm or cleft or cañon,
it could hardly be called a glen. It ran into the very heart
of the hills, for a mile or two, as far as he could see, but
beyond it there were crags with pine trees, and beyond those
more crags, and beyond those, crags with snow and more
crags. To his right he could see very little. Foothills shut
in the line of sight on that side. Wherever he looked there
was no sign of the works of man, there was desert, rock,
desolation and death. Between sixty and seventy miles
of unknown country still lay between him and the coast.
With some tough tendrils which had escaped the fire he
contrived slings for the two ollas. He was now equipped
with bread and water for two days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he judged that the chasm or cleft would give him an
easier path into the hills, he set off towards it. As he drew
near to its entrance, it looked like the entrance to hell. He
remembered that he had read somewhere, or somebody had
told him, that the Indians dreaded these clefts in the mountains,
and said that unspeakable things lived in them.
Now as he drew near the mouth, he heard far up the cañon
something like a voice, which was not a voice, crying in
the heart of the rocks. It was a strange, metallic cry of
“Ohoy!” The echoes repeated it. It was no beast that
he knew. It was not like a beast. It was like the voice
of the rock itself. He stopped at the very mouth of the
cañon, trying to think what that voice could be. It was
not any human voice, and yet it had a human ring. It was
not the voice of any beast, and yet it came, as it were, from
the strength of a beast. It could not be the voice of a bird,
no bird could be big enough, and yet there was something
birdlike in its tone. If it were not the voice of a man,
beast or bird, what could it be? Though it could not be a
bird, it was likest to a bird; there was something spiritual
and birdlike about it. It gave him the impression of some
giant bird, some bird of poetry, some phœnix or roc, crying
from a full heart. Then in its deeper notes it sounded like
the voice of some giant who was beating on an anvil, and
crying as he struck the blows, “Ohoy!” At these times
it came with a pure metallic clang, which thrilled him to
the marrow. He stood still to listen to it. Whatever it
was, it came from some living thing, it had not the rhythm
of any machine. It was not any drill or pile-driver beating
into the heart of the rock. Sard’s mind offered many
suggestions, one after the other. Now it was like some
great bell, but it was not a bell. Now it was like some
ringing true blow struck by a gigantic tuning-fork, or like
the blow of an axe upon a gong, or like the drilling of some
gigantic woodpecker into a musical wood. He could not
think what it was. It was not sorrowful nor joyful nor
terrible. It was great and strange. It came from the
heart of the wilderness of rock, miles from any human dwelling.
It was like the rock speaking. Into his mind there
came again those words which he had read or heard, “The
Indians do not go into the Sierra, nobody goes into the
Sierra; there are strange things in the Sierra which do not
want to be known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He asked himself whether he were not delirious and
imagining this noise. But it rang clearly and made an echo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cañon was paven with clean dry desert sand. It led
into the heart of the hills. The side of the mountain had
been snapped asunder there and torn fifty yards apart.
Sard could see a great black boulder midway up the cliff, on
his right hand, and its other half on his left hand. He saw
the patterns of veins and lines, where they once had joined
each other. It needed some little resolution to go on
towards that noise, but he repeated his proverb, “A danger
met is less than a danger expected,” and went forwards
toward it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were no tracks in the sand, perhaps no human foot
had trodden that path for fifty years or five hundred years.
“Here,” he thought, “I may come upon some unknown
beast or bird or race of men or giants, for there may be anything
in a place like this.” Half a mile up the cañon he
stopped, for in front of him the walls of the cañon drew
together, and there at each side of the chasm the rock had
been hewn into a semblance of columns, a hundred feet high.
Drawing a little nearer, he saw that the heads of the columns
were carven with the heads of monsters which were crushing
human skulls between their teeth; blood seemed to be
flowing from their mouths; blood spattered the columns;
as he drew near, he could hear it dripping on the rocks
below. The noise of the great bird, or whatever it was, had
been silent for some time; now he heard it much nearer and
with a new note, not of joy nor of sorrow, but of laughter
that had no feeling in it. Sard stopped; he felt his hair
stand on end, while his heart seemed to come up into his
throat and thump there till it was as dry as bone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the same, I’ll go on,” he said; “there’s no going
back. That thing knows that I’m here. If I’ve got to die,
I’ll die, and I may as well get it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the time the great figures on the columns seemed to
chew their quids and the blood spattered down upon the
rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re only those streams,” he said, “with iron ore or
with red pigment in them, and they’ve led them in channels
to those figures’ mouths. That’s all it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all that it was, but in the dusk of the cañon and of
the day, to one very weak and weary as well as feverish, it
was enough. He walked boldly up to the feet of the figures.
They stood in blood, like butchers, and the red water
splashed Sard as he stood there. Though he had expected
much, he had not expected what he saw. The two great
columns stood one on each side of a narrow pass, not more
than four feet across. Within the pass the cañon widened
out again, but not very far. On both sides of it the rocks
had been carven into gigantic shapes. It was an avenue of
the gods, all of them terrible; they seemed to turn their
heads and look at him; the wardens at the gate seemed to
turn round upon him after he had passed them. Into his
mind, from some forgotten book or speaker, came the phrase
of what the Indians in that country had said of these old
temples, that their gods come to life at dusk, and are alive
all night, and live on men. They seemed to gnash their
teeth and lick their lips, and to tremble as he drew near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have thought nothing of it had he had so much
as a dog beside him. A lunatic, even a village idiot, would
have seemed a comrade and a backing to him. But he had
to face it alone. He backed into the rock of the pass and
tried to reassure himself, but he kept telling himself, “It
was one of these things whom I heard singing. They do
come to life at dusk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he said, “It isn’t so. If these things were beautiful,
I would fear them, but they are not, and there is nothing in
them that I will recognise as gods. These things are all
over this land: I have heard of them. I’ll go on, and if
they kill me, they’ll get little glory by it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on, and as he went a strange moaning music
seemed to wind from one god to another. It was the wind
striking sharp angles in the rocks at the chasm top, but it
sounded like the song of the figure of Memnon in Egypt.
Just in such a way should the thoughts of the gods pass to
each other, without a movement of the lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those Indians spoke the truth,” he thought, “when
they said that the gods speak in music from dusk to dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the head of the cañon was a small stone temple, high
up at the top of a flight of steps. The columns and the walls
were brightly painted with images of terror and of power, in
war and triumph. Bats were flickering out from the temple
door. They were the first living things that he had seen
since he entered the cañon. They made him feel that he
was coming back to life, after walking in the kingdom of
death. As he went up the temple steps, which were as
perfect as when they had been laid down, centuries before,
the voice of the bird, or whatever it was, rose up from somewhere
in the mountain not far ahead. It rose up with a new
note, it was like laughter with exultation. He could see
nothing because the temple shut away all that was in front
of him, but he heard above the noise of the laughter the
clanking as of enormous wings, slowly rising from the
ground and gathering power and moving away and away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he entered the temple there came a great rush of many
hundreds of bats, whirling past his ears into the air. He
passed between walls of carven and painted figures, which
were still sharp and bright in detail. He went through a
first room, as long as a cricket-pitch, into another, which was
pleasant with the sound of water. A pool had been cut in
the rock in the midst of this great room; water spouted into
it from the tongues of grotesque heads. At the end of the
room there were stairs leading up to an altar made of a piece
of black obsidian chipped to a point. At the back of this
altar there were rooms filled with the murmur of pigeons.
These rooms must once have been the priests’ dwellings.
They were now dovecotes for the blue rock-pigeons which
flew out, on his approach. He clambered out after them on
to a terrace cut upon the rock of the mountain for two
hundred yards by a people who had no explosives save the
will of their rulers. There was no green thing in sight,
nothing but rocks and sand. The rocks were of every
savagery of splinter, of savage colours, bright blue, yellow,
red and black, all spiked and toppled and tumbled, and only
brought into order upon this terrace by the unknown
priests of dead gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took what he could of the eggs of the rock-pigeons,
then shaped his course and went on into the wilderness,
until his way was barred by a cliff across his path, eight
hundred feet high and more. He walked along it for over
a mile, but found no scaling place. At the end of his walk
the cliff bowed over so as to make a shelter or cave. Here
in some remote time some forgotten tribe had built up a
house for themselves by piling a wall of stones without
mortar, between the hollow and the light. The path of
these men still led to their entrance, a hole in the wall, just
big enough for a small man to crawl through. Sard did not
dare to try to enter by that door for fear of snakes. There
was a sheltered place among the rocks where he lay down to
rest. He fell into a deep sleep, and slept until the cold woke
him. He felt something pressed against his chest which had
not been there before. It was some snake which had
crawled there for the warmth. Very cautiously he moved
his stiff arms, until he could fling it from him, and leap up
in the one motion. He leaped clear of it, and then leaped
clear of the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then about four in the morning and intensely cold.
The snake was perhaps too sluggish to attack. He was
too miserable with cold to stay longer there. He ate a
little of his food, and went on along the face of the cliff, until
he found a place of fallen rocks where it was possible to
climb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to him that he had gone for hours out of
his way trying to find a path, and that already he was
weaker than he had been from want of proper food and rest.
He knew now how easy it would be for him to die up there
in the Sierra; why, he might wander for days trying to find
food or drink, the way out or the way back. He knew now
that he might have been wiser to risk the silver escorts, and
follow the railway across the desert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that day he wandered on among the mountains, far to
the west of his proper course. The crags of a great snowy
peak were like a wall upon his right hand, they seemed to
edge him off to the west at every point. He would walk
for a mile and then think, “Now I can get across to the
eastward,” but always when he had scrambled up the screes,
he would come to some cliff which he could not climb. He
saw no living thing in all this day, except two little birds
running among the rocks, and the eagles quartering in the
heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last as he wandered, he saw above him a gash or
chimney in the cliff. He scrambled to its very foot and
looked up it. There was a percolation of water down the
side, which he tasted and found sweet. The rock was very
rotten, but he saw that it was a way up this cliff. As it was
a possible means of getting back to his course, he set himself
to climb it. It took him an hour to reach the top, and as he
scrambled up to safety above it, the thongs of his ollas
broke, and both jars dropped to the bottom of the chimney
and smashed to pieces there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found himself on a great heave of rocky mountain
which went on to a pine forest. Beyond the pine forest the
main crags of the Sierra rose, covered with snow. They
were blindingly bright in front of him, rocks as blue as steel
and ice as white as death, a wall between him and the sea,
which he would have to climb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about sunset, when he was entered into the pine forest,
he smelled suddenly a smell of smoke. It was the smoke of
burning pine-cones or pine-needles. He judged that it
came from a little fire, because he so easily lost the scent.
He turned towards it, thinking that even the most savage
of mountain Indians would be less terrible than that loneliness.
Sometimes he lost the scent, then he cast about like
a dog, until he picked it up again. Presently he was almost
certain that he heard a moan. It seemed the fitting speech
for such a place. He went towards it, and soon heard the
moaning pass into something much more savage, a cursing
and a calling down of vengeance. After a minute of
violence, it died again into grief and mourning and
lamentation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went towards the noise and came round some great
rocks on to a scene which he remembered until he died.
There was an open space there with the tracks of men and
horses on the sandy floor of the pine forest. Someone had
kindled a little fire there, and the ground was littered with
bits of tamales. Beyond the fire, swinging so that his feet
were sometimes covered by gusts of the smoke, a dead man
hung from a pine branch. At the foot of the tree, crouched
and moaning, was a woman. She was rocking to and fro
with her grief. From time to time she stretched her arms
abroad and cursed and screamed in a kind of rhythm or
poetry of hate. Then the grief again became too strong for
her, and she moaned and lamented. One of the dead man’s
slippers had fallen into the fire and lay half burnt there.
There was a paper pinned upon his chest, with the word
“Traitor” drawn on it with a burnt stick. The paper was
a coarse paper bag which had once contained chewing
tobacco. The man was quite dead; he must have been
hanging there since noon. Both he and the woman were
Pardos. From the tracks near the fire it was plain that
about twenty had been at the hanging. It was the act of
justice of some gang. It was a shock to Sard to find man
as harsh as that desolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man was of middle stature, very broad and powerfully
built, with a big, broad, rugged face and grizzled curly
hair. His arms, which had been bound in front of him,
were knotted with muscle. Sard cut him down and laid
him on the ground and cut loose his hands. He saw that
the man had been shot after being hung. He did what he
could to compose the body, and asked the woman if there
was nobody near at hand who could help to give him burial.
The woman did not answer, she was possessed with her grief
and continued to rock to and fro, crooning, moaning, and
sometimes bursting out into cursing. He asked if there
were any place to which he could take her. He motioned
that she should go home, and offered to take her thither.
At first she did not understand. At last it seemed to enter
her head that he was trying to take her from the body or to
take the body from her. She rose up, foaming at the
mouth, snatched a knife from her belt, and stabbed at him;
then stood snarling and cursing at him, while sobs shook her
and tears ran down her face. He did not like to leave her
there in that wilderness, but she was not in any mood to
let him help her or even to know that he wished to help.
He asked if he could carry the body for her to the settlement.
He was standing at some little distance from her,
speaking slowly and distinctly, so that she might understand
what he was saying. At the end of his speech he
was almost certain that somebody laughed. Glancing
sharply to one side, he was almost certain that somebody
slipped behind one of the big pine trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s there?” he called. He leaped to one side and
caught sight of somebody behind a tree. He saw that
behind this person, at some little distance, were two women.
They seemed to be negresses. Their faces were covered,
and they seemed to be the slaves of this hiding man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing here?” the man said. He spoke
the English of an Occidental who had lived for some years
in an American port.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trying to reach the coast,” Sard answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you want to be getting on. There’s nothing here
that concerns you,” the man answered. “You’d best pull
out for the coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is the way to the coast?” Sard asked. “Is
there no trail that will take me there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trail? Hell!” said the man, “find your trail yourself.
Beat it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to beat it,” Sard said. “Can you tell me if I
can get across the Sierra, going eastwards from this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the man, “you can’t. You must go south-eastwards
from here, keeping along the line of those peaks
there, and after about ten miles you’ll find a gap that they
call the pass of Hermita. That’s the only pass in all that
range.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I reach the coast from that pass?” Sard asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll find out what you reach when you get there,” the
man said. “Now beat it just like hell, or you’ll reach
nothing this side Jordan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard glanced for just one second or half-second at the two
veiled women. They had not stirred during the talk, but
in the half-second of his glance he saw one of them start,
and in the same half-second he knew that he was in danger
and leaped to one side. It was all over in half-a-second,
but in that half-second the man had fired from behind his
tree. Sard heard the revolver bullet go past him. He
dodged to a tree, then away to another tree, then to a third.
The man dodged after him, firing whenever he saw a target.
The shots came very near: Sard turned and ran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on running for a quarter of a mile, till he was
over the brow of the hill. Here he turned at right angles
to his track, and ran along the rocky hillside into a glen
which had once been wooded with pines, but had been burnt
out half a century before. Spikes of charcoal, twelve or
fifteen feet high, rose from the ground all over the hillside,
like an army of witches. He dodged through this wood and
went through it diagonally, keeping uphill. When he
reached a bend in the hill, he lay down for breath. He
could see no trace of man nor any trace of life, nothing but
wilderness, rocks, burnt sand and burnt pikes of trees, the
sun looking at it all with indifference, bringing no life to it,
and the wind from the icefields floating over it, bringing
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard looked away to the south-east, where the man had
said that there was a pass. He could not be sure, and yet it
seemed to him that at about that place the hills did seem to
fall down into a kind of saddle, as if there might be a pass.
Elsewhere he could see nothing but a line of crags, neither
sign nor prospect of a pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may as well die there as in another place,” he said.
“Why should the man have lied, when he meant to kill me
the next instant? But my only chance to get across that
pass is to go now as fast as I can put foot to earth, before he
can get there first with his gang to head me off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tired as he was, he set out for that gap or saddle in the
Sierra. He went cautiously, taking care not to expose
himself upon skylines. Presently the sun went down. He
went stumbling on, in the night, keeping his direction by
the stars. At about midnight he could go no further. He
reckoned that he must have done ten miles. “In the
morning,” he thought, “as soon as it is light, I shall see
this pass.” There was a brook of water coming down the
mountain where he stopped. He was guided to it by its
flashing and its tinkle. He came to it and found it slightly
brackish but drinkable. He drank a very little, and bathed,
cold as it was. In a little flat space near the water he found
a patch of grass. It was little better than hay, but there
were some green blades pushing among the dead, and he ate
some for his only supper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he slept and dreamed that he was in the lazarette of
the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>, surrounded by food, barrels of prime mess
beef, barrels of prime mess pork, tanks of new ship’s biscuits,
hot out of the oven, casks of split peas, cases of raisins, jams,
preserved meats, cheese, butter and pickles. In his dream
the steward of the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> came to his elbow and said,
“I’ve put your coffee in the chart-house, Mr. Harker, and
I’ve cooked you a few of those rock-cakes that you like.”
Then he woke and found himself in the desolation, in the
grey of the dawn, with a few blades of grass for his only
sustenance. But there in the stream below him was a little
clump of plants, bearing still the pods of the seeds of the
season before. They were not pods, they were ears, and it
was a sort of grain. Most of the grains had been shed
abroad, but out of the whole clump he harvested one handful,
which he ate almost grain by grain with the husks.
They were tasteless but left a slightly bitter after-taste.
Hungry as he was, he saved a few with some of the grass
for his dinner. It was perhaps five in the morning when he
gathered the grain, and only six when he set out to find the
pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not gone very far into the wilderness of rock in
which he was before he realised that he was not likely to
find any pass. For centuries the great crags of the Sierra
had scaled their husks on to these slopes in the heats of the
summers. It was a world of tumbled stones, blocks, crags
and pinnacles, many of them polished into strange forms by
the dancing of the sand about them. He was at that point
at which the peaks seemed to come down into a gap or
saddle, but he was shut from it by cliffs of a hundred feet,
too steep for him to scale. When he had first set out in the
morning, he had feared lest his enemies should be waiting
for him there, but when he saw the rocks, he knew that no
man would be there except himself. Yet he felt sure that
there must be some way through the mountains there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wandered on, trying to find some point in the cliff
which he could scale. With boots nailed in the soles, he
might have tried these crags, but he was wearing only the
cut-down Bluchers which had been given to him before he
left the coast. In these it was quite impossible for him to
climb. They slipped aside from under him. This was the
first day in which hunger became a torment to him. It had
been present in him ever since the first day, but now it possessed
him. At about midday he came to a little lake where
there was a dead tree growing out of the water. Out of the
tree came a piercing and terrible crying from a hawk that
seemed to be warning him away. Terrible as the noise was,
it was still companionship in that silence. It was something
to see and to hear a living thing. The hawk had no fear of
him. He walked to within twenty yards of the tree and the
hawk looked at him and cried. Presently it rose and circled
round and sank away upon the wind, leaving Sard utterly
alone. He drank of the water of the lake and pushed on up
the hillside to a point where the cliff seemed scaleable.
Here as he went he heard noises that made him think that
multitudes of men were at work in the mountains near him.
There were noises of footsteps and of voices, noises of tools
beating upon metals, explosions and the rumblings of
machines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now midday, and even at that season the sun had
power to loosen stones from the cliff-face. Little stones
were falling all round him with little rustling patters like
stealthy footsteps. Sometimes a bigger stone would fall,
bound for a few feet, and dislodge some other stone.
Sometimes little trails of earth and stone came slithering
down. Higher up on the great crags boulders fell at
intervals, thundering like guns and sending echoes. It was
like the laughter of demons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached the summit of the crag and saw beyond him
another steep ascent leading to another wall of rock. This
ascent was paved with rotten stone, into which his feet sank
over the ankles at each step. It was rock made rotten by
frost and sun, and it broke like clay under his feet. The sun
burned upon his back as he walked, and wind from the icefields
blew sand into his face. He persevered until he
reached the cliff beyond, only to find that there was no
climbing it. It rose up sheer and the point seemed to overhang.
When he tried to scale part of it, the foothold and
the hand-hold gave way beneath him. It was stone that
had ceased to be stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the heat of the day he learnt that there was no pass
there across the mountains. The man had misled him, to
bring him into a desert from which there could be no escape.
There was hardly any sign of life in all that wilderness,
except a few evil-looking shrubs about a foot high, so
armed with spines that they seemed all teeth. He had read
somewhere that all things in the desert are deadly. These
shrubs, the hawk, the asp basking in the sun, and the
scorpion beneath the rock, were the only dwellers in that
waste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made up his mind that there was nothing for it but to
go back over his tracks and start again at the pine trees.
Evil as the men there were, he felt himself drawn towards
them, not from companionship nor from a longing for his
kind, but by the thought of the bits of tamale and beans
which had littered the ground about the hung man. He
plodded back across the field of rotten rock, scrambled down
again to the lake, and was amazed to find how little that
distance was in returning which had seemed so vast in the
going. He bathed and drank out of the lake, found some
shelter among the rocks from the wind and the sun, made
sure that there were neither snakes nor scorpions there
nor any nest of hornets. He repeated the sailor’s proverb,
“He who has water and sleep has no cause to grumble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slept until the sun went down. He was wakened by
the crying of the hawk. Rousing up from his lair, he saw
the bird perched on the tree with his wings spread, crying
what seemed to be a curse upon all that desolation. Hope
suddenly came into Sard, for perhaps there was a nest with
eggs within the tree. He had been too tired to think of it
before, but now the very thought gave him life. He shook
with excitement. He went out and swarmed up the tree,
found a nest, and though the hawks beat at him and struck
him with wings and talons, he took the two eggs, each bigger
than a duck’s egg and of a mottled reddish colour. In the
nest was half of a large lizard which the hawk had brought
thither. At other times he would have shrunk from such
meat, but now he judged that if it would nourish the hawk,
it would nourish him. He ate it with the eggs and wished
that it had been ten times its size. Having sucked the eggs,
he broke and licked the eggshells. He found that he was
not thinking of the wilderness. His thoughts were almost
continually in a little English country town, at a grocer’s
shop, where there were boxes of eggs at the door. He kept
thinking of those boxes of hundreds of eggs together,
perhaps a thousand eggs in one shop, and of rounds of
cheese, weighing a stone apiece. But the eggs were what
stirred him most.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thinking of these eggs, he stumbled and scrambled back
over the eleven miles of rock to the pinewood. From his
childhood he had been accustomed to take bearings
wherever he went, and he had little difficulty in finding his
way. In the moonlight he saw the tree with the cut rope
still dangling from the bough. Under the tree was the
body of the dead man, which had been roughly buried where
Sard had laid him. His feet stuck up out of the earth, one
bare and one slippered foot. Sard did not think of him, but
of the bits of tamale that had been scattered there the day
before. To his intense joy they were there still; altogether
there were enough bits of tamale and bean pulp to outweigh
a ship’s biscuit. Hungry as he was, he determined to save
half of his find for the next day. He thought, “I depend on
a bandit’s hanging for to-day’s food: to-morrow I need not
expect to be so lucky: ‘it is not always May’: still, ‘God
will provide.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He followed the tracks of the bandits till he heard a wolf
howling, with a dog answering him howl for howl.
Presently, as he went on, he heard horses squealing at each
other: he smelt horses. Next he heard a man singing in a
shrill falsetto, with many shakes, to the twangle of a guitar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following the noise in the moonlight, he came to a flat
pan or gully through which a brook, that had made the
gully, still passed on its way to the sea. The hills came
closely about the pan, giving it shelter from all gales: this
(with the water supply) had made it desirable to the Indians
in old time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians had long since gone from it. It was now
peopled by the outlaws who had done the hanging in the
pine-barren: their tracks led into it; their voices sounded
from the midst of it. Sard made out a line of huts stretching
irregularly across the pan on the line of a track or trail.
The falsetto singer was in the midst of the pan, dancing as
he sang. Men were sitting about at the doors of their huts,
talking, or at least uttering remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such, indeed, is life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Between Sunday and Monday there is ever midnight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She, being a woman, is, as one may say, a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The gringos, the accursed: is there anything more
accursed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good wine, good water and good sausage: truly three
good things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard heard these things uttered with all the dignity of a
Solomon pronouncing judgments. Dogs were nosing about
among the huts, picking bits of tamale. Sard felt that it
would be wiser to move boldly down to the village than to
stay skulking in the brush till a dog nosed him. He walked
boldly down into the gully and passed at the back of the
first huts straight into a lover with his lass. Both cursed
him under their breath, but were too much interested in
themselves to heed him. He muttered an apology as he
escaped. A few huts further along the line he came to a
corner where an old ruined adobe wall jutting from an
occupied hut made shelter for him. He settled into the
shelter, meaning to wait till the men were quiet, when he
hoped to be able to find food or a pass, perhaps both. He
knew that he was in the presence of men who would cut his
throat if they found him, yet he listened to what was going
on with enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two or three men were sitting on the other side of the
adobe hut; they were engaged chiefly in silence, which they
sometimes broke with speech, but more often by spitting.
The wind blowing from them brought Sard wafts of cigarette
smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that someone passing at the back of the house?”
one asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” another said. “It was some dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To me,” another said, “the noise was as of a pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pig or a dog,” the second replied; “when I said that
it was a dog, I meant that it was not a Christian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked for a while about different kinds of Christians,
of which there seemed to be four sorts: themselves, the
ricos, the rojos, and the gringos. There seemed to be
something not quite-quite, something not of the sincerest
milk of the word, about the last three sorts. They talked
about pigs when they had finished with the Christians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never will I be as the gringos,” one said, “who will eat
of pig, even though it be nourished upon their grandmothers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My uncle, who lived not here,” the second said, “being
indeed from Havana, a city of Cuba, sold certain pigs to
certain sailors who were gringos. These pigs these gringos
greedily ate; their eyes shone, my uncle said. Yet were
those pigs, pigs that had eaten many Christians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lo, now,” the third said, “it is not pigs who eat
Christians, but witches, the accursed ones, who take the
shape of pigs that they may eat: this also only
gringos do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet are the gringos fools,” the first answered. “There
is Anselmo, who spoke with one but yesterday. Hola,
Anselmo, come tell us of the gringo with whom you spoke
upon these mountains. Hither, Anselmo. Listen, you, all of
you, that you may die with laughter at what Anselmo tells.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause while Anselmo came to the group:
there were greetings of “How so?”; then the first speaker
spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anselmo,” he said, “these have not heard of your
meeting with the gringo upon these mountains. Tell them,
then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” Anselmo answered in the voice of him who had
shot at Sard the day before. “It is thus; if you will see.
I was in the mountains, in the pine-barren, where lately a
justice of the people was achieved. I, sauntering there,
considering many things, since it is my nature to consider,
beheld suddenly a gringo, beastly even beyond the nature of
such. For a moment I thought, ‘Lo, now, a prospector.’
Then I saw from certain signs that he was neither this nor
that, but an Americano, a Tejano, an Inglés, what matter?
This one (I also saw) was lost, as such always are if ever
they leave a marked road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Good day, sir,’ I said; since it is ever my custom to
be courteous. What, we are not brutes nor Luteranos, I
hope; we can be civil one to other. Civility, as they say,
costs nothing, yet makes many debtors. I, therefore, did
not spit at him as one without faith. ‘Good day, sir,’ I
said, ‘I trust that you are well, that your señora is well,
that your honoured parents preserve their health, even at
their great age.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He rolled his eyes upon me like a cow dying of thirst.
The gringos have the eyes of cows rather than of men.
‘Tell me,’ he said to me, ‘the way out of these mountains.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Truly, sir,’ I said, ‘you who bring civilisation to our
savageries will not so soon leave us. Stay, I entreat you,
to dine, or at least to sup, or to sing thus to the piano as do
the women of you gringos. Yet, since you must leave us,
continue,’ I said, ‘a day’s journey north-eastward, till you
reach a place where all the rocks are rotten. There you
will find a path over the mountains, good for men, excellent
for beasts, having grass, inns, a road, good air, good water
and good bells, gravel soil and Holy Communion.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a big man, even for an Americano. He wore
no boots, but slippers, such as women wear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you sent him to the rotten rocks,” the others said.
“But did he go, Anselmo? He surely did not go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Americanos believe all that they are told,” Anselmo
said. “He either went to the rotten rocks or to another
place far from me, which was my desire in speaking to him.
Since there was nothing to be had from him, then plainly
it was my task to be rid of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Long live Anselmo!” the man said. “So he went to
the rotten rocks without question. This is it to be a
gringo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without doubt he will be at the rotten rocks, dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men laughed at this: presently the youngest of
them said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say that he had slippers such as women wear?
Would it be worth the while to retrieve the slippers for
Mariquita?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would not,” Anselmo said. “This man was outcast
from the gringos, unable to live even their easy life. His
slippers were not women’s slippers, but the wreck of boots
cut to that size. He was in all respects ruined: moreover
he was lousy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They continued to talk of gringos for some little time,
though the thought recurred to the youngest of the men
that Sard’s body might be worth the rummaging: he
asked Anselmo whether Sard had “a belt of the Americans,”
or at least “a pouch for tobacco, such as he had
seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Anselmo answered. “This gringo had nothing:
even the crows will have nothing from him. Had he had
anything, I, Anselmo, would have had it: as it was, let
the vultures give Anselmo thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked on, of gringos, gringo women, the women
of the district, the recent cock-fights, the ingredients of
sausages, the natures of parasites, etc., etc., till Sard,
lulled by their drawling low speech, fell asleep. He was in
a dangerous place, but danger will not keep men awake
so well as love or grief. Besides, few stop to identify a
sleeping man. He slept as a sailor will sleep, like a dead
man. In his sleep, some two hours later, he shifted about,
so as to detach a piece of adobe from his shelter. It fell,
with a little clatter which he half heard through his drowsiness.
Unfortunately, it roused a little dog within the hut;
the dog began to bark. Sard sat up at once, wide awake;
his movement knocked down more adobe; the dog barked
louder: a man within the hut cursed the dog; but the
dog, aware of Sard, would not be silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” said the man in the hut, “be silent, Chaco.
Listen; there is someone there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who would be there?” a woman asked. “It is but
a dog, prowling for bones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know who may be there,” the man answered,
“but it is no dog, since dog will answer dog with
barking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is some drunkard or some pig of the poblacion,” the
woman said. “Come here, Chaco; down, dog; quiet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, Sard in rising to his feet stirred Chaco to
bark louder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your drunkard or your dog or your pig,” the man
said, “these are likely excuses, are they not? Where are
my boots?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard heard him drag his boots to the bedside, muttering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What then do you expect to find, Andrés?” the
woman asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know well what I expect to find,” Andrés
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I know no such matter,” she answered, “since
the expectations of a husband are beyond the wit of wives.
If you will tell me, then shall I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know, then,” Andrés answered, “that I expect to
find Martin, your lover, who taps here, like a second
Pyramus, and shall die here in his sin, like a second Chico
the Blanco.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard did not wish to be the second Chico the Blanco; he
slipped up the line of huts as swiftly as he could. He slid
round the corner of a hut, under its eaves, into the grey of
the wall. He was hardly quiet there when Andrés came
rushing past looking for Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay, Martin accursed,” he cried; “we have accounts
to settle, offspring of a dog.” He ran, cursing, along the
line of huts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The village or poblacion had not composed itself to
sleep: it was perhaps always ready for a row. Sard
heard a general rushing to doors, as the inhabitants came
to see the fun. Some boys brushed past Sard, who joined
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it? What is it?” the boys asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Andrés seeks Martin, to kill him,” Sard answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Andrés is killing Martin,” the boys cried. “Come,
boys, Andrés has killed Martin.” Sard found himself in
the midst of a crowd of men, women and children, hurrying
up the line of huts. The crowd stopped towards the end
of the line where Andrés was beating with his knife-hilt
upon a door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come out, you Martin,” he was crying. “I will have
thy liver as a bake meat, yea and I will mince thy heart
and eat it with red pepper, without grace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a general edging back of the crowd at this, to
get out of the line of fire from Martin’s door: Sard edged
back too, till his back was against a hut wall. He could
see Andrés’ wife at her hut door, peering after her husband.
All waited for Martin to answer the challenge: Andrés
even waited for a reply: none came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, scum of a Martin,” Andrés continued, “half-breed
of a toad and a heretic, you justly fear my vengeance.
See, now, brothers, this Martin, before I take his skin to be
my bed-mat, makes his last prayers: he confesses, he sues
for mercy. But I am not one to grant mercy till blood has
flown on my front teeth. So come out, Martin, offspring
of a dog, till I crack your marrow-bones with nutcrackers
and take your marrow for boot-grease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the door of Martin’s hut was flung open and a
woman faced the madman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it calls Martin?” she said. “Who is it
couples a fine name with the filth of a drunkard’s ravings?
You, Andrés? I thought no less. Martin is away, as is
well known, or by this your tongue would have been tied
round your neck with your own entrails, dog of a drunkard.
Away, accursed one, trouble not the houses of the honest.
But when Martin returns, then he shall know of this,
Andrés, and then, Andrés, shall you be squeezed in the
press till we know if your blood be wine or oil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard expected that Andrés would at least reply, but
there was silence. Martin’s wife took up the word once
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you people of the town,” she said, “have you
nothing better to do than to watch the antics of this fool?
Go, every one to his house, or Martin shall deal with you,
even as with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence again for about thirty seconds, then
three or four of the children, who had been on the outskirts
of the little crowd, edged sheepishly away. They were
followed by others. Sard had no time to dodge or hide;
any movement of the sort would have betrayed him. He
stood where he was, somewhat bent and peering towards
Martin’s hut, with his left hand shading his face and eyes.
Half-a-dozen people, children and grown-ups, passed him
on their way to their huts. They looked at him rather
hard, but no one spoke to him. A man and boy, as they
passed, looked perhaps harder than the others. After
they had passed, Sard heard the man ask under his
breath:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was that by the corner of the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy said, “Old Ortiz, I thought. Good-night,
Ortiz.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard answered and muttered good-night. As he spoke,
a couple of lads, who were running, jolted into the two
friends and jolted Ortiz out of their minds. Up and down
the line of huts people went home and closed their doors.
Martin’s wife stood at her door, looking at them. The last
to pass was Andrés, who went shambling past, muttering
and twitching. Sard heard him mutter, “With my good
knife I would have laid him low, I would have laid him
low.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now from Andrés’ hut came the cry of a woman:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is that creature calling himself a man, to whom
the church has bound me in matrimony, who suspects me
of infamy? Where is this Andrés, who from the blackness
of his heart asperses the whiteness of my honour? Let me
see him that I may cast his foul calumny in his teeth.
Is it for this, O dog of all the dunghills of Spain, that I
redeemed thee from thy life as hangman’s boy and made
thee a knight-at-arms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who had not gone home hurried to watch Andrés
receive his wife’s eloquence. Sard saw Andrés enter his
home, but then something made him look up suddenly.
He saw that Martin’s wife, who had come a few paces from
her door, was looking at him with curiosity. It was bright
moonlight; no one who looked at him could fail to see that
he did not belong there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m caught now,” Sard thought. “It’s neck or
nothing now. Well, the straightest way is the quickest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked straight up to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam,” he said, “I’m not a spy or the police, or
anything. I’m lost here in these hills; will you help me
out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him for some moments. “Go further up
the line,” she said, “the third hut from here is empty.
Pass in there and have no fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She closed her own door in his face, and Sard did as he
was bid. The third hut from hers was empty. He went
into it. At some early time there had been a mud wall
across the hut, dividing it into two. This had fallen into
a pile of loose earth. Sard got behind this pile and thought,
“Well, here I am; and if that woman lifts a finger, my
throat will be cut on this doorstep, and that little beast,
Chaco, will lick my blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited; each minute seemed an hour. At the end
hut of the village the man still sang to his mandoline, in
his falsetto voice, a poem of intolerable length and folly,
which Sard recognised as a rhymed romance of the early
17th century. Footsteps passed up and down outside the
door. Once three men came to the door and stopped there,
muttering in low voices for two or three minutes. They
were smoking cigarettes and spitting. One of the men was
carrying harness, which clinked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of them said, “Well, sooner or later that’s what it’ll
have to come to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And another said, “We can count on you then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other replied, “Well, come here, come on inside
here; I’ll just give you my reasons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had his hand on the door-latch and the door eight
inches ajar, when the other said, “No, not in there, thank
you. There are tarantulas in there. Come on up along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved away. Then for a long time Sard sat there,
thinking of what they had said: “There are tarantulas in
there.” He heard a queer, regular, clicking noise in one
of the corners, two or three yards from him. It was a
little dry, slight clicking noise, rather like two wooden
skewers being tapped together. Some one had told him,
years before, that tarantulas click their mandibles together
before they attack. “That’s what it is,” he thought,
“it’s a tarantula in the corner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept himself breathlessly still, and then suddenly he
heard a little light pattering. There was a swift, flurrying
scutter along the floor, a shrill squeal, something leapt and
fell across his feet and writhed away squealing. He
heard the thing, whatever it was, rat or mouse, trying to
shake itself free in the corner of the room. The squeals
soon died to a whimper and the whimper to a sigh, as the
tarantula in the darkness sucked his fill. Sard presently
heard the corpse sink down, as the insect moved away.
He waited with his feet drawn up under him and his hands
covering his throat, lest the insect should want more blood
and come to him for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time went slowly by, the man with the mandoline
ceased his song, somebody who wished to sleep cursed a
howling dog until it came indoors. But the wolves out on
the mountains crept nearer. From time to time one would
cry his cry. Whenever this happened, the dogs in the
huts whimpered and were uneasy. Everybody, by this
time, had gone to rest in that village of outlaws. Sard
thought that it could not be long before the woman redeemed
her promise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then from somewhere up above he heard the sound of
drunken singing, which became louder as the singer came
down into the village. Sard presently picked up the words
of the song, which was one of the romances of the Moors in
Spain. As the drunkard entered the village, every dog in
every hut flew to the door barking with all its strength, in
spite of the curses and boots of the owners. The drunkard
paused outside the row of houses and cried in a loud voice,
“Here I am, old Pappa Peppy, and I’m as drunk as I want
to be. Come on out, Martin, Tomás, Ramón, Espinello,
for I tell you I’m not Pappa Peppy, but an avenging angel
of the Day of Doom. I’m the Lord’s second coming and
now I’m come.” And at this he let fly with two revolvers
at the doors of the huts, in succession. Drunk as he was,
he had extraordinary precision. The bullets thudded into
the doors as though he were running a stick along palings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Tomás,” he cried, “and I’ll shoot the white out
of your eye. Come, Ramón, and I’ll see the colour of
your blood; for I’m Pappa Peppy, and I’m as drunk as
Noah when he got home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came another volley. Sard noticed that none of
the bullets came into his door. He thought: “This is
that ruffian’s hut, he’ll presently come in here to sleep.”
The drunkard went to another hut and beat upon the door
with the revolver butt. “Come out, Ramón,” he said,
“and let’s shoot, man to man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard heard the voice of Ramón: “Take another drink,
Pappa Peppy, and let us shoot in the morning, for now I’m
sober, and how can a sober man hope to shoot like you?”
A bottle seemed to be passed through a cautiously opened
shutter, and Sard heard Pappa Peppy say, “You’re a
Christian gentleman, Ramón. All I ever wanted was a
drink, and now I’ve got it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard heard him take a drink and then come unsteadily
to the door of the hut where he lay. He fumbled at the
door, opened it, and stood groping there, feeling along the
wall as though for a ledge where matches and candle stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lamp’s gone,” he said; “th’ only lamp I ever
loved all gone. They all turn from Pappa Peppy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came fumbling along the wall into the hut, and then
went fumbling back and shut the door. Then he said:
“Well, I’ve got box o’ matches. First of all, I’ll put the
nice brandy up in the corner. I’ve got a box of matches
somewhere. I tell you I’ve got a box of matches and then
I’ll show them. They aren’t going to fool Pappa Peppy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard heard him creep back to the door, holding on by the
wall, and heard him say: “I’ll just kneel down very carefully
and I’ll put down the brandy there, and I’ve got a box
of matches somewhere. I know I’ve got a box of matches
somewhere. The man who says I haven’t got a box of
matches, I’ll shoot the white out of his eye. Who says I
haven’t got a box of matches? That’s the sort of skunk
they are. They daren’t say it to my face, not one of them.
Of course I’ve got a box of matches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He proceeded to empty his pockets in the dark, muttering
over each thing. “What in the name of all the saints is
this? Bit of a cigar. What in the—oh, bit more cigar.
That’s a bottle of peppermint, all broken. Ugh! the glass
is all broken.” A reek of peppermint liqueur filled the little
hut. “No good looking for them in that pocket,” said the
man; “there’s cigars in this pocket. There goes the box
of matches. I knew I had a box of matches and it’s gone
on the floor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The box of matches jerked out of the pocket and fell
very close to Sard. The drunkard went down on hands and
knees, diffusing a warm breath of peppermint liqueur and
aniseed brandy. Sard felt as though he was to leeward of
one of the Spice Islands. The man began to grope for the
box of matches, patting with his great hands and breathing
with difficulty. “I know the box of matches isn’t far,”
he said. “It’s very stormy to-night. In a wind like this
one has to go miles out of one’s way. Oh, the wind’s roaring,
the wind’s roaring! And well it might roar, for I’m
not Pappa Peppy, I’m the Day of Judgment. I’m the Day
of Judgment, and I’m dawning and I’m coming up over
the mountains now, just like blood, and if I lay my hands
on that box of matches, they’ll be the first thing I’ll blast.
I’ll teach ’em to fool the Day of Judgment!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he paused in his search. He had missed Sard
by half inches two or three times. Presently Pappa Peppy
stopped not more than a yard from Sard and said in a little,
cold, clear voice, “Lord pity the poor sailors on a night
like this! That’s ten times I’ve been round this room
looking for that drink. It’s been witchcraft. I can see
you here, and well I’ve known you were here all the time,
and I know you’re doing it with your witchcraft, you black
beast. I’ve watched you doing it, but you needn’t think
to scare Pappa Peppy. He’s the Lord’s, he is; he isn’t
one of yours. He’s a lily for the pure to look to. He fears
not Satan nor all his minions. Ah! here’s the bottle.
I knew I’d come to it, if I kept to the south far enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard heard the cork drawn from the bottle and the gurgle
as he drank raw aniseed brandy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was what I wanted,” said Pappa Peppy. “A
man like me who takes a lot out of himself has to put it
back or go under. And I’ll have another like that—ah!
I’ll have another like that. And now I can lie down on
the floor without holding on, and let the storm roar itself
sick. I don’t care, I don’t care. To-morrow when I get
hold of that box of matches, I’ll show it what I think of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bottle dropped from his hand. It must still have
been a third full, for as it rolled away some liquid gurgled out
of it. Pappa Peppy gurgled in sympathy or in tune, and
composed himself to sleep, sitting up against the wall. He
passed into a drunken unconsciousness almost at once,
breathing with dreadful difficulty, being in fact at the point
of strangulation, through his throat pressing against his
collar. After two or three convulsive gasps, he shook
himself out of his dangerous position and lapsed sideways.
“There’ll be death upon the sea this night,” he murmured;
“I’ve known gales, but never anything like this.” After
this he slept and the village slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must have been full midnight when the door opened
suddenly and the cool night wind blew in from the desert.
The woman was there. “Come you,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pappa Peppy groaned and fought with his drink. Sard
rose up and came to the door. The woman had a little
leather bag full of food for him and a leather-covered gourd
full of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you go past the houses,” she said, “and follow up the
cañon, to the end, you will come out below the icefields.
In all my living here I have only heard of one man who has
ever crossed those fields. His name was Gonzalez: he
lived a hundred years ago. He crossed them and reached
San Agostino in five days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s San Agostino that I want to reach,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go then,” the woman said, “and may you have that
man’s luck. He was my grandfather. But know this:
you’re in the land of the bad men, the land of Red Sleeve
and the Jacarillos, and not one other soul for thirty miles
would have done what I do, not one other soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me your name,” Sard said, “that if ever I get
among my people again, I will think of you with gratitude
until I die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have no names in the Jacarillo country,” she said;
“but if ever you come to some church in Christian country,
say a prayer to the Virgin for Juanita of the Bolson. And
now go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was herself gone on the instant and flitted back like
a thief into her hut. Pappa Peppy gurgled in his sleep and
cried, “I’ll deal with you if I can get at you!” and then
cried, “O God!” and moaned. Sard knelt down, picked
up Pappa Peppy’s box of matches, took his two pistols and
cartridge belt, loaded both pistols, slung his provisions over
his shoulder, and set out with a pistol in each hand from
that city of the Jacarillos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifty yards from the huts, he entered the cañon, now
stealthy with the noises of the night. Near the mouth of
the cañon a sentry lay asleep within the ring of his rope which
screened him from snakes. Sard crept past him on tiptoe,
but need not have taken such precaution, since the man
slept like the dead. Not far away, something large, grey
and silent, probably a wolf, which had been creeping up to
steal the sentry’s food, glided into the sage brush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another fifty yards the trail turned upwards into the
hills, out of sight of the gully. Sard went on as hard as he
could put foot to ground for three hours. Then coming
suddenly round a corner, walking rather carelessly, thinking
that he was quite out of the reach of pursuit, the faint smell
of smoke crossed his path; immediately he was in sight
of three mud huts by the side of the road. He was reassured
an instant later by seeing that two of the huts were
ruined. There came a rustling from within the third;
a hideous old Indian woman came out. She might have
been any age from a hundred and twenty downwards. They
looked at each other in the grey light in the heart of the
wilderness. She mumbled something in reply to his
question, but any wits she once had had long since gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard pointed to the snowy peaks below the stars in the
sky. He asked in Spanish, “Is there a trail across the
Sierras?” He made signs of a trail and of mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some memory lit up intelligence in her faded mind. She
laughed. “They all go over the mountains,” she said.
“All the young men go into the mountains. That’s why
all the mountains are white, for all their bones are on the
mountains. Your bones will be white on the mountains.
I live up here among the mountains and I can hear them.
All the round white skulls come rolling down the mountains.”
She ran into her hut and returned with the skulls of three
white men. “They all rolled down the mountain,” she
said, “for they are Indian mountains, and the white men
know much, but they don’t know about the mountains.
By and by I’ll have your skull. I’ll put him in the ants’
nest to clean and I’ll keep him on the shelf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard hurried away from her, but for about half a mile she
followed him, hugging the skulls. He pushed uphill as hard
as he could go, but in the stillness of that glen he could hear
her voice for a long time, saying that his skull would roll
down the mountain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was now no trail, but he fixed his course straight to
the frozen crag, which gleamed above him against the sky.
Dawn found him still pushing onward and upward in a
trackless wilderness that seemed to bear no living thing.
When the sun rose, he found some shelter among the rocks,
where he might defend himself if attacked. He expected
that the Jacarillos would trail him as soon as it was light
enough to see tracks, and that with ponies or donkeys
they might well be on him before noon. In this he was
unjust to the Jacarillos: they did not trail those whom they
judged to be already doomed. In his shelter he ate, drank
and then slept; he did not wake until the setting sun shone
through a crevice among the rocks on to his face. After
eating and drinking he set out again into the Sierras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All littleness was gone from the mountains now. His
world was one with the elements, the sky, great stars, and
gigantic crags, silent except when now and then there came
a roar from something breaking in the glacier, or the thunder
of a boulder falling. The moon rose to light his going up
a slope of rock, which seemed curtained by other slopes of
rock. Here he laid down one of the revolvers which he had
taken from Pappa Peppy. He laid it on the rock beside
him. Instantly it slithered down, gathering small stones
as it went, till it was thundering down the rocky slope far,
far below, with an avalanche about it. He saw it flash and
presently heard a report, and realised, as he had not realised
before, that he might have slipped like the gun and gone
gliddering down among the boulders in the same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about midnight he reached a ledge of rock, where he
slept until daybreak. When he woke he saw what he took
to be three cloaked Indians, sitting on the ledge beside him.
He sat up and looked at them. They withdrew their heads
from their blankets. They were no Indians, but vultures.
They looked at him with interest and without fear. He
spoke to them, they muttered a little and moved uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’re waiting for me to die, are you?” he said.
“I’m not dead yet.” They craned and sidled with their
bald heads. “Get out of this,” he said, smiting at one.
It went sidelong off the ledge, and the others with it. They
beat with their wings, recovered their poise, and sailed out
into the air. An instant before, they had been squalid,
stinking, huddled creatures; now they were floating in the
majesty of beauty. Two hovered at a little distance from
the ledge, the third rose above it in a short spire. He had
never seen any bird of prey circling at such close quarters.
He watched the great pinions soar up above him, while
the others hovered away and mewed and cried. Suddenly
the bird above him launched itself down upon him and beat
him with its great wings, so that he was almost over the ledge.
Instantly it was up in the air and repeated its swoop. It
came down sighing and struck and hissed at Sard, and
immediately the two birds who had been waiting, swooped
and struck at him. “So you’re going to get me down into
the valley and pick my bones,” Sard said. He lay flat
down upon the ledge, face upwards, and drew his other
revolver. The bird came down on him again, crying and
smiting. He fired; the bird went up, poised, went up a
few feet further, beat with its wings, mounted yet a little
further like a towering partridge, then crumpled up and
dropped. Sard saw it strike and roll and lie still. Its
companions swayed away to look at it and then descended
to the body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard looked down and wondered how he could ever have
climbed that crag at night without falling. He knew that
he could not go down it by daylight. He looked at the
crag which rose up above him from the ledge, and felt that
he could not climb it. He had reached a point from which
he could neither go nor come. He ate and drank and then
thought, “Perhaps when I’m rested I will be able to try
this rock. If not, I shall end here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slept on the rock until the beating of the midday sun
became unbearable. He twisted to an angle where his head
could lie in some shade, and slept again. He was aware in
his sleep that someone stood upon that ledge and told him
to come on. He sat up, looked at this figure and knew that
it was only partly human. In his dream, or fever, it seemed
like the spirit of the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>, fierce, hard, and of great
beauty. He told himself, “This is all nonsense. The
<span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> is a ship, she has not even a figurehead, but a
fiddle-head; this is a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the figure said, “I am the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>. I can find a
path for you.” She lead on up the rock and Sard followed.
He could see her in front of him; he followed where she
trod. There was a great star above the crags. The crags
were thick with greenish ice, the star shone upon the ice,
till it glittered like a crown. Sard said, “I’ll put my hand
on the crown of the mountain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At daybreak he came out on a wild place near a brook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was grass there whistling in the wind. There was
a little bird somewhere, not far away, crying a double note
that sounded like a curse, continually repeated. Sard
drank of the brook, sheltered from the wind and slept; nor
did he know when the woman had passed from there.
Afterwards, he was puzzled about that part of his march;
sometimes it was in his mind all blurred, like the events of
a fever, sometimes it seemed the only reality among things
dreamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he woke he was out in the snowfields. He thought
that he had reached the summit, but he found that he was
only on the top of a small shoulder. Beyond and above him
were crags, sprinkled, heaped or overwhelmed with snow,
some of it dirty from fallings of rock, some of it violet from
shadow, the rest of it glittering. There was no sign of
any living thing. If he looked up, there were peaks
glittering against the sky; if he looked down, there were
glittering snowfields, crags and chasms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not see the country from which he had come,
because greyness was hiding it from him. Grey shapes,
like the leaders of a herd, were moving into it. A herd of
mists followed their leaders, so like oxen that he expected
them to bellow. They jostled on in myriads till all the
lower slopes of the mountains were blotted out. Soon a
sea of mist washed all about those miles of Sierras; the peaks
stood out of this sea like islands. “If that sea rises,”
Sard thought, “I shall be drowned up here. I must move
while I have light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had his direction from the sun. He pushed on, now
up, now down, over snow of every degree of rottenness. He
had a little food left in his wallet. He guarded this, but
slaked his thirst with snow and chewed upon a piece of his
belt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening it began to blow bitterly cold with a small
snow. In one of the whirls of the gale he found himself
upon a piece of a made road. He could hardly believe his
eyes; but there was no doubt: it had been made by men.
It had been cut out of the side of the crag; the crag at its
side had been carven with the figures of the gods. A tall
god with his tongue transfixed by a bramble was pouring
libation on an altar; beyond the altar was a door leading
into the crag. As he stood there, the sun shone out through
a rift to light the eyrie he was perched upon. Used as he
was to heights, it made him sick to think of the will that
had spent men, like water, to hew that rock at that height.
The sun shone into the doorway. Looking within, he saw
two figures upon a throne. They sat side by side, holding
each other’s hands. They were staring straight at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “what are you? Who are you there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peering in, he saw that they were the bodies of a king and
queen who had been buried there in that mountain tomb,
perhaps centuries before the Spaniards came. He crept
into the tomb to look at them. Once the door of a slab of
stone had been mortared flush with the face of the crag, but
it had fallen like most of the road that led to it. The
mummies sat side by side, holding each other’s hands.
Masks of gold still covered their faces. The masks had, no
doubt, been modelled on the dead faces and preserved likenesses
of that king and queen. Both were tiny; they
looked like children to Sard. They were the rulers who had
driven men up the mountain to make that road. All about
the walls were paintings of the lives of those two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” Sard thought, “he was a king and when he died
the kingdom fell to pieces. She knew that it would be so,
so when he died she killed herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun, which had been shining, was now suddenly
blotted out again. A cloud of intense blackness seemed to
rush out of the heaven to engulf the crag. The air was
filled with crying and small snow. Sard sat there in the
darkness and fell asleep at the feet of the king and queen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He woke often, because it was so cold. Whenever he
woke, he heard the gale full of bells tolling, or voices crying
to him: often he answered them. Once or twice he went
to the door to answer voices; but no one was there except
the gale, full of small snow. He wondered if he were alive,
or if this were death; not final death, but the leaving of
the body which is the prelude to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning the wind dropped: the snow ceased: the
storm went bodily off across heaven like an army that had
been beaten, in a sullen mass, with rearguards of sulphurous
smoke followed fast by the angels of heaven with light.
The sun followed hot upon it with fire, till presently it was
far, far away, engaged upon the southern horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Sard came out into the sun, he saw a name cut or
scratched upon the lintel of the door of the tomb. The
letters were lastingly but rudely graven by a strong illiterate.</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>Gonzalez Medina.</p>
<p class='line'>1795.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Gonzalez Medina,” he said. “That woman’s grandfather.
The only man who ever crossed these mountains.
Here I am upon his track. If he blazed his trail thus, I
may still find my way out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The finding of that blaze was companionship to him all
that day, which was a hard day, one of his hardest.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the worst of the hardships was the knowledge that
all was not well with the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>. He had put so much
of his virtue into that ship, that she was almost part of him.
He felt that things were going wrong on board her. Sometimes,
as he struggled on, he knew that someone was in his
place, making evil, and that Captain Cary wanted him. He
kept thinking that Father Garsinton had brought the evil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not remember Father Garsinton clearly, yet he
stayed in his mind, like a blur of evil.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long afterwards, in thinking over his climbing of the
Sierra, some things came back into his mind as pictures or
dreams or happenings; he never knew really which they
were. Often it seemed to him that at this point in his
journey he heard a beating of pans and the murmuring of
bees: he saw bees swarming and a big Spanish woman
beating pans to make them settle. He asked to be allowed
to beat pans; afterwards he hived the bees into a straw
basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the woman suggested that he should drink some
honey drink, and took him to a house where she and her
husband, a much older and much yellower person, gave him
drink in a strange cup and asked him what he saw after he
had drunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said, “I see a path leading upwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said, “Go along the path. Now what do you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said, “I see a little house at the end of the path,
shining as though it was made of some white metal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said, “Is the door open?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said, “No, the door is locked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said, “Go and put your hand on the sill of the door
and see if the key is there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said, “It is there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said, “Open the door and go in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened the door, but inside all was darkness with a
smell of carib leaf which choked his throat and made his
head stupid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said to him, “What do you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said, “Nothing but a brazier burning carib leaf, which
throws out a thick smoke which chokes me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said, “No; but to right and left of the brazier what
do you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said, “Two pillars and a person bound to each pillar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said, “Look well; who are the people bound to the
pillars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked with all his strength into the thickness of the
smoke. It was agony to him not to be able to see clearly,
but he said, “One is Juanita de la Torre and the other is
myself, and we are being choked by the smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said, “It is not the smoke, it is something coming
from the brazier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then from the brazier the little tongues of flame, writhing
among the carib leaves, changed to red snakes which were
arms and hands that came twining about the throats of the
two bound figures. The fire in the brazier glowed into the
likeness of a human soul with the face of Father Garsinton,
who laughed and said, “I crush you lesser spirits as a
sacrifice to my master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then all became dim with carib smoke choking and stupefying,
but the words, “I crush you lesser spirits” were
repeated many times, while the house, the honey-cup, and
the Spanish man and woman faded and disappeared.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after this he climbed a spine of rock, expecting to
find on the further side a dip of snow with a higher spine
beyond it. To his amazement, there was no such dip nor
spine; but the slope of the mountain falling below him into
a different world. On this ocean side of the Sierra there
was no desert. Instead of a chaos of rock blasted by the
sun to rottenness, there were heaves of hill flinging their
waters to the forests. Forests covered the valleys like a
fleece. In places where there was no forest Sard could see
little white houses. The smoke of a train ran like a caterpillar
along the valley beneath the foothills. Beyond the
foothills was a dark mass, like a bar of metal, yet not like a
bar of metal, because it seemed to be alive, it gave Sard
the thought that it trembled: it was the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far away, on the brink of this darkness, was a smudge or
cloud in which some chimneys stood like stalks. The smoke
merged into the air so that a tiny golden dome glittered: it
was the cathedral in San Agostino. Almost at once, quite
clearly, though faintly, in some chance channel of upper air
or freak of sound, the chimes from the dome reached Sard.
It was a familiar Spanish chime to which Sard always put
the words of the poet:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Gloria in las alturas,</p>
<p class='line0'>Cantad in vuestra jaula, criaturas.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Worn, footsore, more than half-starved as he was, he
could not see his goal nor hear that chime without “singing
in his cage.” There was his desired haven, within how
many hours of march? He could not tell how many hours;
perhaps very many hours; but no matter what his pains
were, he felt sure that having seen his goal, he could reach it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going down was like soul’s delivery after the toils of the
last days. In a few miles he was in the timber, going down
a glen of great trees towards a smell of honey which came
thickly upon the air to him. Sometimes he missed it for a
few yards, but it always returned on the next gust. Sometimes
it brought to him memories of tea in England, but
more often the intense memory of a picnic at Yapavai,
where he had sat near a field of the yellow melilotis hovered
over by countless blue butterflies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the glen he came out on to a heave of the
hill, where he found the cause of the honey scent: eleven
great trees lay broken on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nine of the eleven were hollow from the ground to the
upper branches. In all these, for perhaps centuries, the
wild bees had nested, till now many hundreds weight of
honey lay broken or spilt upon the ground. Over this, in
some places, the bees were still flying confusedly, but
by this time most of them had gone with their queens
to new shelters. Gorged bee-eaters sat on neighbouring
boughs. Some small mountain bears boldly foraged in the
tree-boles. They clawed out great paws-full of comb which
they plastered into their muzzles in spite of the stings.
Sard found a piece of broken yellow comb the size of a bathsponge.
On this he fed with thoughts of the prophets fed
miraculously in the wilderness. After this, the miseries of
the wilderness fell from him as though they had never been.
Perhaps the honey had in it some drug of excitement or of
comfort. He wandered on happily, feeling sure that all his
troubles were at an end. He bathed in the pool of a
mountain stream on the banks of which wild strawberries
grew so thickly that the ground looked like the foot of a red
hawthorn tree after a storm in June. After this he went on
through a forest of big timber which grew on easy slopes
with little undergrowth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon had risen before he came to any trace of men.
He came to a clearing and followed wheel-tracks downhill
till he saw the lights of huts. Men in the huts were beating
tin pans and singing:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Is that Mr. Riley</p>
<p class='line0'>Who sets such a styley?</p>
<p class='line0'>Is that Mr. Riley who keeps the hotel?</p>
<p class='line0'>Is that Mr. Riley they speak of so highly?</p>
<p class='line0'>How d’ye do, Mr. Riley, are you doing quite well?”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>As he came to the door of the first hut, a man who was
tapping out his pipe there, hailed him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, sport! where in hell do you come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Over the mountain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mountain, hell! Are you looking for a job?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doing it for a bet, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Trying to rejoin my ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell!” the man said. “Here, boys, here’s a son of a
gun come across the mountain, trying to rejoin his ship.
Come in, son, and have one on the house.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>At noon the next day Sard was in San Agostino, washed,
shaven, fed, reclad, and with money in his pocket. He
walked in the crowded street, listening to speech, hearing
the bells. Shops were full of food, drink, shoes and clothes;
women were looking into shops; work was going on; men
with places in life were filling them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no place. He knew now how little a thing will
put a man out of a place, into the wilderness beyond, where
to be at all is to be an outlaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped on the steps of the Consulate to look at the
ships in port: among them was the big English steam
yacht, the <span class='it'>Yuba</span>, which he had seen in Las Palomas, as it
seemed in another life. A man hailed him by name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Harker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Billy Binge, his old captain of the main.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Harker,” he said, “are you ashore here? Yes?
What topping luck! Could you take the <span class='it'>Yuba</span> to Santa
Barbara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir James has sacked his old man for crooking his little
finger: going on the jag, in other words. He wants a new
old man, muy pronto, and the worst of it is all the masters
on the beach here are out at elbows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only in your gear,” Billy said. “These other fellows
are in their souls. I can vouch for you personally. So if
you really can take her, come along, I’ll fit you out a bit and
then I’ll take you to Sir James.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One minute,” said Sard. “Have you heard anything
of an abduction case at Las Palomas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Abduction of Miss Kingsborough?” Billy said.
“We’ve heard nothing else. She’s been carried clean
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where to?” Sard asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Search me,” Billy said. “Some damned trader in
Eve’s flesh; but there’s a fine old breeze about it. Now
come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What brings you to San Agostino?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard told him in few words.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Billy Binge’s recommendation was sufficient; Sir James
engaged Sard to command the <span class='it'>Yuba</span>. She sailed late that
night, up the coast to the Recalde reef to take some dredgings.
After a few days at the reef, she sailed for Santa
Barbara, where she arrived at noon just nineteen days from
Sard’s going ashore at Las Palomas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir James stood at his side as he brought the <span class='it'>Yuba</span> into
Santa Barbara harbour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve not been here recently, Captain Harker,” he
said. “You’ll not know the place; it’s a different place:
almost a different city. They’re making this place the
Athens of the West: I say <span class='it'>they</span>, but it’s really <span class='it'>he</span>, the
Dictator, Don Manuel. Look at the cathedral; there’ll be
nothing so beautiful in the New World when it’s finished.
Do you see your ship, the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Sir James, she isn’t in the sailing ship berths.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is unfortunate for you,” Sir James said, “as I
suppose it means that she has both come and gone; but it
is fortunate for me, for I hope it will mean that you will
come home with us in the <span class='it'>Yuba</span>.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<h2>PART FOUR</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>s</span> soon as Sard was free, he went ashore to see Messrs.
Wrattson &amp; Willis’s agents. He was puzzled by
the <span class='it'>Pathfinder’s</span> not being in the port. She could
not be overdue, he thought, in just dropping down to leeward.
She might have come and gone: in which case he
would have missed her by a few hours. “More probably,”
he thought, “she has gone down the coast to Otorin to
complete her cargo. I’ll find her there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the agents, as he asked for his letters, one of the
managers of the firm, a tall, alert inscrutable man of about
thirty-five, a Mr. Waycock, heard his name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you Mr. Harker of the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>,” he said, “come
into my office, will you? I want to speak to you. Sit
down here: the cigars are at your elbow. You don’t
smoke? You’re the first sailor I’ve ever known who could
say that. You know, Mr. Harker,” he said, “I heard that
we might expect you apart from the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>. I had
news of you from a man with whom I have business
dealings, a man called Douglas Castleton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he been here?” Sard asked. “Where is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that a little like asking where is the curlew?”
Mr. Waycock said. “It is best, perhaps, not to ask where
Mr. Castleton is. I understand that he is not here at the
moment, but away again on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on a business
journey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What news of the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>, sir?” Sard asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>!” said Mr. Waycock. “Haven’t
you heard? She was wrecked last week on the Snappers.
She’s a total loss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the Snappers!” Sard said. “How on earth did
she get there? Are all hands saved? Is Captain Cary
safe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve not heard then,” Mr. Waycock said. “Of
course you couldn’t have heard. No, all hands are not
safe. They had pestilence on board. Captain Cary is
dead. He died some days before the ship went ashore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead!” Sard said. “But he was well when I saw
him. How did you hear this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had a cable from Port Matoche where the crew
were landed,” Mr. Waycock said. “Here it is. It gives
just the bare facts, but if you come here to-morrow morning
at nine o’clock, the crew will be here with Mr. Dorney.
Mr. Hopkins is still in hospital. The rest will be coming
in this evening by the mail. You can see them here in the
morning. Here’s Dorney’s cable as far as it goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard looked at the flimsy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad Captain Cary didn’t lose her,” he said. “But
how did they put her on the Snappers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she came down on both knees like a riderless
horse,” Mr. Waycock said. “They had a fever on board.
I don’t know more than that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Sard thought to himself. “I know the kind of
fever they’ve had on board, Captain Cary dead and myself
not there, Hopkins ill and Dorney who can’t navigate, a
man who doesn’t hold with sights but can foodge a day’s
work, as he calls it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they bringing Captain Cary’s body, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he was buried at sea,” Mr. Waycock said. “A
fine seaman, Captain Cary—of the old school, that is. Of
course his day was over. He couldn’t have held his own
much longer. It’s just as well as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Sard said bitterly. “He didn’t lose her and he
hadn’t got the sack. But he wasn’t wanted and they let
him know it. You must excuse me, Mr. Waycock. I have
been with Captain Cary for ten years. I must go out and
think of it. I will come in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the door as he was going out, he said, “One other
thing, Mr. Waycock. Douglas Castleton is mixed up with
a very queer company of men. I suspect that some of those
men were concerned with abducting a woman, a Miss
Kingsborough, from a house in Las Palomas. I have
reason to believe that the men in that abduction came from
Santa Barbara here and were going to bring Miss Kingsborough
here to some Mr. B. or Sagrado B. who runs a
rum-running business and is plotting revolution against the
Dictator here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I think you’re quite mistaken about that,”
Mr. Waycock said. “Our friend moves in very queer
company, but not in company of that sort at all. Besides,
Miss Kingsborough has been found. The case was reported
in the press a week or ten days ago. She was taken by
bandits, not by rum-runners. She was held to ransom.
I think I could find you the account in the paper. I have
got it somewhere here. She was in a mining town quite
close to Las Palomas, a place called Tlotoatin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tlotoatin!” said Sard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, do you know it?” said Mr. Waycock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been there,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, here’s the ‘Humanidad,’ ” Mr. Waycock said.
“Here’s the account, ‘Miss Kingsborough found.’ Cost
her £400.” He pointed the paragraph to Sard, who read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'>“<span class='it'>Miss Kingsborough Found.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cable from Las Palomas confirms the rumour, which
we quoted in our columns yesterday, that Miss Kingsborough
has been restored to her friends and relatives.
Yesterday the agents of the British Consul visited the place
appointed by the bandits with the sum demanded for the
lady’s ransom: £400. Great reticence veils what took
place at the meeting, but the bandits were men of their
word and Miss Kingsborough was set free. A press agent
who interviewed her late last night declares that she is
looking none the worse for her adventure, and that the
bandits treated her with courtesy. Thus ends a nine days’
wonder, and thus, as we hope, will end the campaign of
calumny which the Occidental press has waged against
the police of Santa Barbara ever since Miss Kingsborough’s
disappearance. The criminals of this atrocity were not
natives of this State, but Occidentales, living on the scene
of their crime. Let the doves of Las Palomas change
their ways before they accuse others of being wolves.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m relieved to find that she has been found,” Sard
said. “So that ends that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” Mr. Waycock said, “this is five or six days
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever hear the nickname B. or Mr. Sagrado
B.?” Sard asked, “in connection with rum-running or
plotting against the Dictator?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Waycock had a broad, smooth, pale face, tranquil
like the face of an image of Buddha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know no one with such a nickname,” he said, “and
there is no rum-running from Santa Barbara. There may
be rum-running from the coast far to the west, six hundred
miles from here, where the rum is made, but none from here.
This fiction of the rum coming from Santa Barbara is made
by the Las Palomas police, Mr. Harker. And as for plotting
against the Dictator, you meant, I suppose, the Don José
faction. Who would shoot the Dictator to put Don José
in his place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don José would, for one,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Waycock laughed. “He hasn’t that reputation in
Santa Barbara,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard suddenly felt that he was in the presence of one of
Don José’s backers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing, Mr. Waycock,” he said, “if Douglas
Castleton isn’t plotting or fetching rum, what brings him
to Santa Barbara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He comes for letters, Mr. Harker; twice a year he
comes to Santa Barbara for letters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If ever he wants lawyer’s counsel or a gaoler’s bribe,”
Sard said, “remember that I will pay for both as long as
I’m alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Waycock considered him with just the flicker of a
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good, then, Mr. Waycock,” Sard added, “I’ll
come in the morning at nine.” He went out into the
street. “Captain Cary dead,” he muttered, “the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>
gone and Miss Kingsborough found. Well, that
ends that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found himself at the bronze of the Bajel Verde on the
beach. He gripped it with his hand, suddenly overwhelmed
with grief. His captain, the old extra-master:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“John Craig Cary, of the ship <span class='it'>Petrella</span>,</p>
<p class='line0'>Thunder-ship and stand-front-under fella,”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>was now a new hand, at sea in death, with perhaps no one
to teach him the ropes. The <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>, who had found so
many paths, where no paths showed, would now find no
more. She would be jammed on the reef in the glare, while
the rollers would surge over her, climbing her stern, rising,
rising, rising, then thundering down, blue, then green, then
blinding, all day long, all night long, till she broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had enough of the sea,” he said. “It takes a
man like Cary to master the sea. Then the day after he
goes, the sea smashes all that ever he made, as though it
had never been.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>Everything there reminded him of Captain Cary. The
bronze on which his hand lay marked the very place where
the Heroic Six had made their stand at the Green Boat.
He had seen them there. He had been with Captain Cary
in the cross-trees of the <span class='it'>Venturer</span>, watching the Heroic Six
hiding, creeping out and firing until their cartridges were
all gone. He remembered Captain Cary stamping and
cursing when the boat patrols put out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, boy,” he had said, “now they will be destroyed.
Their retreat’s cut off. But fly down on deck, boy, and
pitch the coils of the buntlines over the sides, so that, if
any of them does reach the ship, he’ll be able to get on
board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had done this and in the dusk of that bloody day
one of those buntline ends had caught a strange fish, Don
Manuel himself, now the Dictator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Sard thought, “it was Captain Cary who saved
Don Manuel and by doing that he made this port the
Athens of the West.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two hundred yards further along the new front towards
the city was a strong shelter made of white Otorin marble.
Something was displayed within it upon a bronze pedestal.
Sard went in to see what it was, because it seemed to be a
ship. It proved to be a big model barque flying the house
flag of Wrattson &amp; Willis: Sard recognised her instantly
as the <span class='it'>Venturer</span>. On each side of the supporting bronze
was a medallion portrait of Captain Cary, with an inscription
in Spanish, which Sard translated thus:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“In eternal gratitude</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To Captain John Craig Cary</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the officers and company</p>

<p class='line0'>For their nobleness to the ruined in the Noche Triste.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Under the inscription was a list of the <span class='it'>Venturer’s</span> company,
divided into watches, just as it had been in that long ago
time. The list ended with the boys of his own watch:
“Adam Bolter, Charles Crayford, Edward Grant, Chisholm
Harker.” Under his own name were two lines of verse:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“They gave their safety, shelter, friendship, bread,</p>
<p class='line0'>To me who had a price upon my head.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Sard was overwhelmed. “So,” he thought, “here is
Captain Cary’s monument. I wonder if he knew of it;
he never mentioned it. I hope that he knew of it. He
must have known of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The model had been made in England by skilled craftsmen
working under someone who had known the <span class='it'>Venturer</span>
intimately. Little special matters, such as the make of
the truss of the fore-yard, the lead of the braces, the design
stencilled on the deckhouse, the use of brass pins in the
poop fiferails, all showed that one of the old <span class='it'>Venturers</span>
had been engaged in the work. “Flackwell, the bo’sun,
helped in this,” he thought, “there is Flackwell’s gadget of
the broom-rack in the bo’sun’s locker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the sun was behind the Sierra; the ships
were dim against the bay and men were hoisting the riding
lights. Sard could hear the blocks creak as they swayed
them up. He went along the water-front to the end, and
then climbed the great white marble staircase, between the
lines of orange trees, to the Plaza of the Martyrdoms. He
had never ceased to be amazed and exalted by the beauty
of the new work. That stair, ten years before, had been
palm-stems pinned into the earth like the rungs of a ladder.
Now it was all Otorin stone, white and exquisite, with
marvellous busts of the martyrs at intervals along the
balustrades: Carlotta, Jane Jennings, Pascual Mestas,
Celedonio Vigil, Agapito Chavez, Luciano Sisneros, Inocencio
Chacon; then Carlotta and Jane Jennings again, with
those five of the Heroic Six who had been killed in the bay.
The faces leaned from among the dark green of the orange
trees. In the groves behind them there were fountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached the Plaza at the top of the stairs. There at
least the Houses of the Last Sighs were as they had been.
They looked dingy and evil in that place of brightness:
they looked as if they would not have any life of their own
until all the lights were turned out. They were inhabited
still, for a little smoke came from one of the chimneys.
Sard wondered that anybody should live still in them;
but he had heard that they were let at cheap rates, being
supposed to be haunted, and that they were to stand thus,
unpainted, till the last of the Don Lopez faction, Don José
and one Rafael, had been shot there like their victims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were three houses together, a big one in the centre,
flanked on each side by a smaller. On the wall of each of
the smaller houses, at breast-height, were the chippings of
bullets, under the legend, painted in white,</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not need to be told that, for he had seen the
prisoners dragged thither to be shot after Don Manuel’s
defeat. He had seen two or three hundred men shot there
by the Lopez faction. He had watched it all from the
<span class='it'>Venturer’s</span> cross-trees: batch after batch, volley after
volley: not men only, but many women, and some children.
He had seen the accursed Reds drag their victims out of
houses. It had not been the suppression of a rising, but a
massacre of all whose virtue shamed them.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Hic ceciderunt.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>He could not see the words without a prayer, that those
who had fallen there had found peace, and that those who
had killed them there might find justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another white temple-like structure in the
Plaza, a round roof upon columns of marble, which sheltered
musicians. In a European city it would have been a
“kiosk” or a “bandstand”; here it was a lovely work of
art, which took away the breath by its grace and fitness.
Some musicians were moving away from the shelter, having
finished their playing: the crowd which had been loitering
or lounging about the music was now breaking up. Most
of it was setting towards a theatre which stood under
bright lights on the southern side of the Plaza. Sard went
with the crowd, with a feeling which he had never known
before, that to be with many people, in bright light, is a
satisfaction, an excitement, a consolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside the theatre doors were the bills of the play,
which gave yet another shock to Sard.</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“Theatre Jane Jennings.</p>
<p class='line'>Numancia,</p>
<p class='line'>by Cervantes.</p>
<p class='line'>Tafoya. Archuleta. Vizcarra.”</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Theatre of Jane Jennings, playing a poetical tragedy by
Cervantes. Why, when he had come there in the <span class='it'>Venturer</span>
Jane Jennings was alive there, a byword, a most notorious
bawd, the talk of all the fo’c’sles in port, infamous herself
and the cause of infamy in others. Adam Bolter had been
to her house and had talked and drunk with her. “A big,
fat, black-haired woman, with a hooky nose: she was
always either swearing or singing lullabies.” Now for her
heroic defiance a simple people had made her a heroine, a
national heroine. All that was evil in her had dropped
from her, like rags or lice, leaving only something noble.
He felt the nobleness. She had had her throat cut there
in front of those dingy houses rather than do a dirty thing.
Now her memory was kept alive in that place, as one whose
fineness alone counted; the rest was rightly forgotten.
She had come from Bermondsey and had been a bawd;
now there were marble busts of her and a theatre named
after her in a capital city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paid tribute to her memory by entering her theatre.
He heard Tafoya, Archuleta, Vizcarra and their companions
speak the verse of that great soldier-of-fortune.
But he could not heed the tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind was full of what he had heard in Mr.
Waycock’s office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it all amount to?” he kept asking himself.
“I met a girl, many years ago, who altered my life for me:
all my time has been a dream of her. Then in my dream,
hearing those men at the fight, I went to warn some
strangers; for they were strangers, name and nation
different from hers. I warned them. I might just as
well have held my tongue and gone on board; they did not
profit by my warning. Now the girl who did not take my
warning is safe and sound with her friends, while my friend
is dead, my ship is on the Snappers a total loss, and I myself
am alive only by miracle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it all mean? Some power, with foreknowledge
and other knowledge, wanted me out of the
<span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> and got me and kept me out of her by the only
means which could have done it. With me away, the
Captain dies and the ship is lost; then I am allowed to
rejoin the ship’s company. Why should I have been
wanted away, save for evil, since nothing but evil came of
my going? The <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> was doomed, so the man who
could have saved her was taken out of her. That ass
Pompey and the foodger Dorney were left to play hell with
her and well they seem to have played it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was lured out of the ship by the appeal to the softest
thing in me. By stooping to the lure, I have made a pretty
mess of things: the ship lost .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all comes from my love for that girl. Even if it be
madness, or folly, or delusion, all that love has been very
real, it is my intensest thing: and the intense things cannot
lie: they are the only true things. Jane Jennings’ intense
defiance was the true woman speaking: all the rest was only
mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tragedy came to an end with the blowing of a trumpet
for the great who had died. Sard moved out with the
company into the Plaza, which was now lively with the
city’s amusement. He went to a little table in front of a
café, and dined there, listening to selections from Gluck’s
“Iphigenia.” He faced the music; the Houses of the Last
Sighs lay to his left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he sat down at his table, before the waiter took his
order, a man in uniform appeared with a pencil and a
printed form. Sard’s name, nationality, ship, duty, station,
lodging and other particulars were asked and noted. “Such
is the law,” the man said. “In every eating-house and
hotel in Santa Barbara. It prevents unpleasantness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting there in the light, among the crowd, listening to
the music, was a pure pleasure to one who so few days
before had been starving in the Sierra. Sard could not feel
that “unpleasantness” was near that happy place: all
seemed so happy. Long after his dinner was at an end he
sat there sipping coffee. His waiter, a big brawny Spaniard
with a good-humoured cynical face, pointed out the Houses
of the Last Sighs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was there, Señor, that they shot the martyrs on the
Day of the Troubles. See, Señor, the bullet-marks. Never
will those houses be cleaned, or painted, or rebuilt, till the
vengeance has been paid; thus has our Dictator vowed.
When the debt is paid, they shall go; until then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
thus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard knew more about the martyrdoms than the waiter,
but in politeness he edged his chair aside, so that he could
see the houses. The two outer houses were closed, with
dark green jalousied shutters over every window. The
central house, the largest of the three, had no shutters,
but the windows were blinded and blank. The big windows
of the ground floor were also shaded by the green, iron
turtle-back of a verandah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The houses are dead,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Señor,” the waiter said, “they are inhabited. A
poor sort of people live in them. See, there, a padre enters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The houses were about forty yards away, under brilliant
electric light. Sard saw a big, muscular priest walk with
the air of a king up the steps of the central house. He
turned at the door to survey the Plaza below him. Even at
that distance his attitude and gesture gave the idea of
domination. He seemed to dilate there. He looked like
a lion conscious of supremacy. His pose seemed to say,
“You canaille exist and die and rot, but I am above these
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something familiar in the man’s presence,
strange as it was. That pride and power of bearing seemed
familiar to Sard: he felt that he had seen it before. As
the priest entered the house, Sard thought that he reminded
him of Father Garsinton, who had begged a passage in the
<span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was like that Father Garsinton,” he thought. “And
it is strange.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sailors would say that it was the sky-pilot
who brought her on the Snappers. I did not hear
about Garsinton at the office. Waycock never mentioned
him, though of course he would not concern Waycock in
any way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tiene,” he said to the waiter, “that priest who entered,
do you know his name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Señor; nor himself. A poor sort of people live in
those houses. Without the priest they would be poor
indeed. ‘They have but birth and death,’ as we say;
with a priest, these will suffice a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know of any people called Garsinton in that
house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know no one there, Señor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all,” Sard thought to himself, “it can hardly be
Garsinton. He will be coming here in the <span class='it'>Recalde</span> with the
rest on a Consul’s order. He can hardly be here yet. Even
if it were Garsinton, his story of the wreck would probably
be worthless. I suppose Pompey or Dorney will lose his
ticket over this wreck, but the fault will be with myself and
my dreams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ordered more coffee. He talked to the waiter about
events in Santa Barbara. The man said, as Waycock had
said, that there was a little rum-smuggling from the western
coast, in that immensely remote part known as “beyond
Caliente.” He said that “things” were settled now in
Santa Barbara. “Revolution, Señor,” he said, “what is
it? A grand name for bad manners. What overcomes all
revolution? Art. And art Don Manuel brings here.
Regard the cathedral .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the western front not faultless,
but what spirit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then, too, the opera. I, a poor
man, have my fill of opera, I sing in opera .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in certain
choruses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All this Don Manuel makes possible. Great
things are shared by all here; this gives security.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard presently rose, thinking that he would take a turn
about the Plaza and then to bed. It seemed to him that to
work in a city like that, where great things were shared by
all, would be happier than working against the sea, which
shares nothing, permits little and surely takes all in the
end. “I must make a new start somewhere,” he said, “on
a new foundation since the old has come to grief. Since the
old ends here, the new had better begin here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though it was easy to say that the old had ended, his
mind was full of Juanita de la Torre, as he crossed the Plaza
to the jut of land called Cachopos. On this jut, completely
covering it, was the nunnery of Santa Alba, whose votaries
kept the Cachopos Lighthouse. Sard had heard of these
nuns. He walked to the end of the Plaza to see where they
lived. He could see little more than the body of their
church, the walls of the conventual buildings and the
pharos with its slowly revolving beam of light. Twice in
each minute, the beam as it came round fell for five seconds
upon the unfinished spire, tower and pinnacles of the
cathedral, making them glow as though they were living
creatures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard watched its coming and going for some minutes.
He had grateful thoughts of the women who kept that light.
He turned slowly back into the Plaza, feeling utterly alone.
He found that the café where he had dined was closed. The
tables and chairs had been stacked away together at the
edge of the pavement; his waiter had gone. Sard took a
seat at another café nearer to the Houses of the Last Sighs;
he ordered coffee and sat there watching the people. All
were going home now, for the amusements were done: it
was almost midnight. Among the last to pass across the
Plaza near Sard was a little old figure of a woman,
who carried a mandoline case and music. Something
about her seemed familiar to Sard. Her name and
state came back to him in a flash: he rose and bowed,
saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Señorita Suarez.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came nearer to him, looked at him hard, but could
not recognise him. She was sixty-five. She wore black
and yellow lace upon her head; her face was yellow as gold,
wrinkled as shrunk cloth; her hair was iron grey, done
in ringlets, her nose was like a hawk’s beak and her eyes like
coals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Señorita Suarez,” Sard went on, “I was in the <span class='it'>Venturer</span>,
years ago, in the Days of the Troubles. You were on board
for some days, with other ladies of The Blancos.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes,” she said, “sad, sad days in the <span class='it'>Venturer</span>.
You have seen that we remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you remember me? I cannot remember you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should you?” Sard said. “I was but a boy then,
and, unlike you, did not make lovely music.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes,” she said, smiling, “always I make music.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Señorita,” he said, “for the sake of old times, will you
let me offer you refreshment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, no,” she said: then, in English, “No thanky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The talk did not seem successful, so Sard said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were lucky in the <span class='it'>Venturer</span>. We saved Don Manuel
for a great future.” The old woman drew back as though
he had insulted her or wounded her to the quick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a great future?” she said, swelling like a cat about
to spring. “For a great future? I trust, yes, for a very
great future; for an execution so great that all this city,
this bay, the mountains and the islands of the sea shall
be black with people come to watch it. Let him live,
Lord, to taste the greatness of that future, the Lord-with-us,
the padre Pipi. You, sailor, dog of the tides, who
caused us the contamination of his presence, and cursed
this city with his life, speak not to Jenny Suarez of dons and
futures, he, the accursed, the accursed, whose footsteps
press blood out of the stones.” She spat towards Sard in
the vehemence of her hate (she did not do it well) and went
shaking, muttering and clicking past him, and so away
down the great marble stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose she was a Red,” Sard thought, “become a
Red since Don Manuel became Dictator. I thought that
perhaps Waycock lied about the Dictator’s popularity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the waiter brought him his coffee, he asked whether
Don Manuel were much loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much, Señor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since when, and why have they named him padre
Pipi?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter looked round in alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Plaza is Blanco, Señor,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, Señor, you know little of affairs here. Let me
then warn you, as a native, never to make use of that
name. It is a Red name, Red as the grid of hell, where I
yet shall see those Red accursed roasting. We of the
Whites call him the Grande. And truly he is Grande. He
is the Lion of the Faith, Grandissimo. Yet even that name,
in certain parts, among certain people, it is not prudent to
speak aloud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very true,” Sard answered. “Truly a man digs
his grave with his teeth, but assuredly he cuts his throat
with his tongue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Viva Don Manuel,” Sard said, “to the great race the
great ruler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen, indeed, Señor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will you close?” Sard asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At one in the morning, Señor; lo, now the day passes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the bells of Santa Barbara very sweetly chimed for
the hour. Instantly, from all over the city, other bells
began either to strike or to chime till the air was trembling
with sweetness of sound which melted into the midnight and
made it deeper. Some of the ships in the bay made eight
bells: a clock in the House of the Dying Sighs struck: it
was midnight. Now while the deepness of a tenor bell
was toning, there came, from Cachopos, perhaps a quarter
of a mile away, the exquisite song of the nuns of Santa
Alba at their midnight office. Sard was spellbound. All
the night had ceased to be of men and folly: it had become
suddenly a thing of stars and flowers and of the joy of the
soul in her God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coming of the midnight seemed to be a signal that
the life of the town should stop. It seemed to bring everybody
home, so that in a few minutes the Plaza was almost
empty and so quiet that one could tell the passing feet:
the small, belated woman hurrying: the guardians in
couples slowly patrolling, pausing to try if doors were
locked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, from one of the streets leading to the Plaza from
the northward, there came the singing of drunkards. Sard
hoped at first, from the noise that was made, that the
drunkards were foreigners; but they were two English
reefers, both sillily drunk, followed by a third, who, being
sober and much younger than the others, was trying to pilot
the drunkards down to the landing-stage. They were
trying to sing some fragment of grand opera which they had
heard that night: they made a bestial row, “between the
bull and the cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard eyed them to see who and what they were: the two
drunkards were from a small barque in the bay: the sober
boy, to his amazement, was Huskisson, a first-voyager from
the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>. Huskisson, a <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>, running the midnight
with these two night-owls, within an hour or two of
landing, and not ten days from Captain Cary’s death. Sard
stiffened and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drunkards bowed low to Sard, laughed, lurched across
to the door of the centre house of the Last Sighs, and banged
upon it with their fists. They shouted a song as they
banged.</p>

<p class='noindent'>One of them called to the waiter to bring them some vinos;
the other, a short, squat, sub-nosed lad, whose name was
Crockums, did not like the waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: You darned mañana Dago, fetch the vinos,
intende, or I’ll smash your papish chops. You want to
forget, you ain’t in no Vatican, now, nor yet in any

bubb-banisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Paggy</span>: No; he’s not a genelum; never fight with a
feller’s not a genelum; never fight with a genelum’s not
(singing) “A captain in the how-d’ye-do brigade. How de
do? How de do? I’m a captain in the how-d’ye-do
brigade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Huskisson, who had not yet recognised Sard, but
was terrified of arrest for disorder, interrupted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, you fellows, don’t make this row; we’ll
have the civil guards on us in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: Make this row?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Paggy</span>: Who’s making any row?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: We’re not making any row, you young pup;
go and lap milk in a tea-joint.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Paggy</span>: He talks like my female aunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: I’ve torn a man’s trousers off for less;
dammy, the sea’s that refined nowadays it’s chronic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the waiter appeared with the three little tin cups
of Santa Barbara claret.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: He shan’t have any vinos now, because he
told us not to make this row.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Paggy</span>: All the more for us.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: Drink hearty, Paggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Paggy</span>: Salue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two of them drank each one vino; then shared the
third.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Paggy</span>: Hold your tumbler, Crockums.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: Go easy.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Paggy</span>: It’s only this red vino.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: You’re giving me more than my share.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Paggy</span>: They give one the purser’s gill here: two
thimbles and a thumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: Here’s how.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Paggy</span>: Here’s health, wealth and unity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as they had swallowed the wine they put down
the cups, breathed deeply, turned, rushed at the central
door, beat upon it with all their strength singing “O come
let’s kick the door in,” to the tune of Adeste, Fideles. At
the second stanza they changed the words to “Let’s
fling the table through the doorway,” seized one of the
tables and prepared to do as the song bade. The waiter
interfered with “Ho, Señores, that, no. The tables, no.
The song, yes, but not to break the tables.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: What do you want, steward?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Paggy</span>: He wants to be paid for his vinos.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: How much for your vinos? Combien de

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The waiter</span>: Tres pesetas.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: Tres pese .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ? tres pesetas?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The waiter</span>: Si quiere usted.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: Who the hell are you calling a keeairy usted?
Hold my coat, Paggy. I’ll have this blighter’s blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Huskisson interfered again, saying that the waiter
had only said, “If you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Crockums</span>: I’ll please him. My mother isn’t going to
be called a keeairy usted by any dam Dago on this coast.
There’s your keeairy usted in your teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seized the tin cups one after the other and hurled
them in the waiter’s face; then he and his Paggy upset a
table apiece, screamed aloud, and ran yelling down the
marble steps towards the port. Sard turned to the sober
reefer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huskisson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were you doing with those two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Helping them to their ship, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know that you belong to a crack ship?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why disgrace her, then, by going about with a pair like
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was trying to save them from arrest, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you sleeping to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the Sailors’ Home, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good, Huskisson, now sit down and eat an ice with
me and tell me of Captain Cary’s death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Huskisson sat down and began to cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Avast heaving, with the tears, Huskisson,” Sard said
kindly. “Tears won’t help anybody. Just take your
time. Eat your ice and then we will walk to your
Sailors’ Home and you shall tell me everything as
we go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is Huskisson’s story:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After Captain Cary left you ashore in Las Palomas,
sir, he waited for you a long time. He wanted to be sailing,
for it was looking very black and he was anxious for the ship.
After an hour or so, he sent Mr. Dorney ashore to look for
you. Mr. Dorney didn’t come back till after eight. He said
he’d been out to a house for you and that you’d started
back by another way before he got there. Captain Cary
was upset by that. He said he hoped you hadn’t got into
any trouble. He said to Mr. Hopkins, ‘I don’t like staying
any longer. The ship’s not safe here in a norther and the
glass is dropping like a stone. Still I must leave word about
Mr. Harker.’ So he sent the boat in again to leave word at
the police about you, sir. The swell was setting in very
heavy indeed when we went ashore, but coming back we
were very nearly swamped. When we got back, Captain
Cary said that there was nothing for it but to leave you
ashore. He was very much upset about it, sir. He said,
‘I wish I had not let him go, but I felt it my duty at the
time.’ And that padre fellow, Father Garsinton, the
passenger, said, ‘Whatever one feels to be one’s duty, is
right, depend upon that, Captain Cary.’ Captain Cary said,
‘I’m not so sure, sir,’ and told Mr. Hopkins to man the
windlass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were well out of Las Palomas, sir. We were the
last to run for it, all except the <span class='it'>Mondovo</span>, and we heard
since that she drove ashore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was after the sea had gone down, when we were well
clear of the Serranas, that the trouble began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It began the third day out, just when everything
seemed settled in for a quick run. It began with quite a
little thing, sir. The geraniums in the cabin were all found
withering. They all died within a few hours: Captain
Cary thought that the steward had given them salt water
by mistake. Well, that passed over, sir, and we thought
no more of it. But then, the next day, there was something
wrong with one of his canaries; something the matter with
its throat. The steward said he thought it must have the
pip. It kept straining with its head as though trying to
clear its throat. And in the course of the day the others
fell ill with the same complaint. Captain Cary supposed
that some poisonous seeds had somehow been packed in
their bird-seed: anyhow they all died. Mr. Dorney told
us that Captain Cary was very much upset at the canaries
dying. He had always counted on his geraniums and
canaries for a bright cabin, and you know, sir, they had
been lovely little singers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Cary seemed out of sorts that night during the
first watch. He said something to the helmsman, who
couldn’t understand what he said. I was near at the time,
time-keeping, and I couldn’t understand either; he spoke
so thickly. Then the next day he fell really ill. He came
down to breakfast dragging one leg and making a noise in
his throat as though he was trying to swallow or trying to
speak. He couldn’t do either; he couldn’t eat nor drink
nor say what was the matter. At first they thought that
something was stuck in his throat, but it wasn’t that. Mr.
Dorney said he thought it was hydrophobia, and Mr.
Hopkins thought it was more like lockjaw. There didn’t
seem to be much pain, but he was frightfully distressed.
He kept trying to explain what was the matter or what
should be done, but nobody could understand what he
said, and it weighed upon him frightfully that people
couldn’t understand him. Mr. Dorney said he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They tried to get him to lie down, but he seemed worse,
lying down. He was very much worse next day. You see,
sir, he was an old man. He’d never been ill before and the
worry of not being able to speak or swallow or sleep broke
him up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Jellybags went aft to be near him in case of a call
that night; so as to give the steward a rest. Old Jellybags
was in a blue funk about it, because we all thought that it
was hydrophobia and that he’d be bitten. Still, he said
he wasn’t going to let any da .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mean any O.S., sir,
look after Captain Cary, while there was anyone in the
half deck to do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We helped him shift his bed aft. We envied him having
all night in. Wolfram saw him at the beginning of the
first watch; he said that Captain Cary seemed quieter.
I suppose that that was about a quarter past eight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The steward peeped in on them at coffee-time next
morning. He didn’t like their looks, so he called Mr.
Hopkins. Captain Cary was unconscious, but still fighting
this thing in his throat; and poor old Jellybags had caught
it: he couldn’t speak nor swallow, but seemed trying to
clear his throat. I can’t explain it, sir, but it was horrid to
see: they felt it so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was the passenger, this Father Garsinton, doing,”
Sard asked. “Most priests in the tropics have some
knowledge of medicine; couldn’t he help or suggest
something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. He said that he had seen nothing like it.
He examined the patients and said that their hearts were
very fluttery. He said that the poison must have come on
board in the air, from the norther, the day we sailed. He
said that it must have come from some very poisonous
place away up north, where there is no sun to kill germs,
and that it came in at the skylight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said that it must have come in at the skylight
because the first things it attacked were the geraniums just
under the skylight, that then it attacked the canaries, close
to, and then spread to Captain Cary, who was so often
there, and from him to poor old Jellybags.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Hopkins said, ‘We’re certainly carrying some
tropical disease, it’s in the cabin where the Captain and Old
Jellybags have been sleeping. We’ll sulphur out all the
cabins.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we sealed all the cabins, both fo’c’sles and both
deckhouses and sulphured them out. Then when we
unsealed them, we mopped them all over with carbolic
solution. We reckoned that that must have disinfected
the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next morning Mr. Hopkins was down with the disease,
just the same symptoms and this fluttery heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could find nothing like it in our medical book, but
Mr. Dorney worked out a dose for a weak heart; but you
see, sir, they couldn’t swallow. When we tried to dose them
they seemed to choke. Mr. Dorney said all along it was
hydrophobia they’d got. You can understand how we
felt about it, sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next day the steward went down with it just the
same as the others. That was one of the worst of all the
things, sir, because with all these people falling sick, one of
the chronometers ran down and something went wrong
with the other. You see, sir, it had been in the infected
cabin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rot, boy,” Sard said, “a chronometer couldn’t pick up
infection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, perhaps it can’t, but that was how we felt
about it when everything in the cabin got poisoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then that morning, sir, poor Captain Cary died in
the room where he was with Jellybags. He hadn’t said
anything that we could understand since he had fallen ill.
You can imagine what we all thought, sir; we all knew
what Captain Cary was. We buried him that afternoon,
sir. It was dead calm and hazy and blazing hot. Mr.
Dorney read the service and just as we put poor Captain
Cary into the sea, that little black cat came out of the cabin,
and it had the disease. It dragged one of its legs and was
fighting in its throat and its coat was all staring. It came
to the grating where Captain Cary had lain and mewed.
Mr. Dorney said, ‘My God, the cat’s got it.’ I don’t
think anything scared the men so much as that cat coming
out; there was a regular growl; and they growled a good
deal too, because Mr. Dorney took the service instead of the
padre. Mr. Dorney said that he was acting captain
and it was the captain’s place to read the service; marriage,
christening or burial. The crowd didn’t like that at all,
nor did the padre; but Mr. Dorney said that they’d ‘joost
have to loomp it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old Jellybags died the next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we got a slant of wind which lasted for three days:
the disease never seemed to do much when the wind was
stronger than light airs. Then the wind died out and it
came on thick, just as we were expecting to pick up Cape
Caliente. It was blazing hot, with mist, just when we
didn’t know where we were. Then the disease came on
again: the poor steward died and the poor little cat died,
and the padre seemed very queer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then Sainte Marie, the French A.B., who had helped
to bring out the steward’s body, went down with it. He
was the first man forward to get it, and, of course, he got
it by coming aft. And now everybody was terrified, not
only at the disease but at being shut up in the mist and lost.
We hadn’t picked up Cape Caliente and we were all afraid
we’d been caught in the southerly set and put to the south
of it on one side or other. We couldn’t tell where we’d got
to. We tested the water alongside to see if we were near
the mouth of the Santa Maria, but the water wasn’t brackish.
We’d hands aloft looking for high land. From time to time
we hove the lead, but it’s all volcanic water there, sir,
just like the bottomless pit. It was like being under a
curse. One of the worst things was that when the padre
went queer he kept intoning the burial service. It was
dead calm and very hot, with the sail slatting and all the
gear jangling and the ship’s bells tolling as she rolled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then about dark that night the wind freshened a little.
We got her to lay a course about west-north-west. She
made as much as two knots for the first couple of hours,
though it was still thick. We had the fog-horn blowing
because we hoped to get an echo if we were anywhere near
the high land. Just before midnight we heard breakers on
the lee bow. Mr. Dorney put her about and kept her on
the other tack for a couple of hours. Then we heard
breakers again on the lee bow. Mr. Dorney put her about
again and took a cast of the lead and got volcanic rock at
125 fathoms. Then the wind dropped and it came on very
thick. We had all hands on deck waiting for a call and
from time to time we heard the padre, sometimes fighting
with this thing in his throat, sometimes calling out the
burial service. It went on like that, sir, for some hours.
Sometimes we had a few stray slants of air and then they
would die away again. At about 3.30 we heard breakers
on the port bow and then breakers on the starboard beam.
Mr. Dorney said we must be among the Chamuceras. Anyway,
we were embayed. I don’t think Mr. Dorney had
been off his feet for two days and two nights, sir. We drew
clear of these breakers, and it was just beginning to grow
light when we heard breakers again on our starboard bow
and then breakers on the port bow and then the wind died
on us, sir, and there wasn’t a breath. Suddenly the padre
appeared on deck in red socks and with a red tamash for a
loin-cloth. He stood at the poop rail, laughing and cussing,
and then the fog cleared away, and old Holdfast, the Vancouver
man, who was in the cross-trees, sang out, ‘Land,
ho,’ and the look-out man shouted, ‘Breakers dead ahead,
sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Dorney sang out to let go both anchors, and one of
them, at least, was let go. Somebody sang out, ‘Weather
main brace,’ I suppose, to lay the main yards aback. Most
of us ran to the weather main braces, and I was on
the rope and we were just beginning to haul, when I
saw something white rise up on our own weather
bow, and then she went crash on to something and knocked
us all off our feet. She got up just as we did and
seemed to look around and wonder what was happening,
and she lifted clear of whatever it was and seemed to
jump out of it, but perhaps it was only the broken water
that gave me the idea that she did, for then she ran
fairly on to it with a crash which tore the boat’s skids clean
off and pitched her fore and main top-gallant masts right
out of her like bitten-off carrots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were the men aloft killed,” Sard asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, they were warned by her hitting the first time.
After that second crash she didn’t strike again, she only
worked down into where there were great breakers all
round us. Then the fog went as though by magic and it
was daylight. We could see everything when it was too
late, Cape Caliente, Port Matoche, and all the coast as far
as the Cow and Calves. We were on the Snappers, seven
miles west of Caliente. Mr. Dorney had been thinking
that we were among the Chamuceras, thirteen miles east
of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, we could take stock of how we were. She
was lying over on her starboard side a little and about a
foot or two by the stern. We judged that she was ripped
pretty well open, for the water was over her ’tween
decks. And now that it was too late the wind began to
freshen and she began to grind where she lay. Mr. Dorney
furled the sails to ease her and got the boats ready for
hoisting out, and by the time the boats were ready she was
grinding down at each swell with a noise like ice cracking
on a lake, and the sea all round her began to come up in a
kind of syrup from our sugar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By eight o’clock it was no joke to be on deck. She
was pounding and breaking the sea. Mr. Dorney decided
to abandon ship. He hoisted all her colours first, house flag,
ensign and number, and then he got off three of the
boats. I went in the bo’sun’s boat. Just before Mr.
Dorney’s boat was put over the side, while we were lying
off watching, there came a great big swell, which passed
underneath us, of course, but it caught the old <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>
fair and gave her a great yank over and everything in her
seemed to fetch away over to starboard with a bang, and
the next swell went right over her all along. It was just
all they could do to get that last boat over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that was the end of it, sir, we’d a bit of a job to
make Port Matoche, for the wind freshened into one of
those local northerly gales which they call Arnottos. But
we landed everybody and we took the sick up to the
hospital. Mr. Hopkins and the A.B. were both much
better when we left Port Matoche. The padre, Father
Garsinton, was quite recovered. He came on here in a
coaster so as to save a day while we were waiting for the
mail. The doctor said that we had got some tropical
infection on board, he didn’t know quite what; he said it
was like medellin throat, but he had never known cases
fatal before. We were all fumigated and had our clothes
baked, which spoiled all our boots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span> break up?” Sard asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” the boy said. “Mr. Dorney, Wolfram, the
Bos’un, and Sails went out in a shore boat after the Arnotto
died down, to see if they could salve anything from her,
but they found only her fo’c’sle and forepeak wedged on
the rocks and the fore-mast still hanging by its gear. She
had broken short off, they said, just abaft her fore-hatch
and the rest of her was gone down into over 100 fathoms.
They said that the worst of it was that she was within a
ship’s length of clearing the Snappers altogether. Another
hundred yards would have fetched her clear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You aren’t allowed a hundred yards, nor a hundred
inches, in our profession,” Sard said. “A ship is either
afloat or ashore, and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time they had reached the door of the Sailors’
Home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here you are at your inn,” Sard said. “Now go up to
your berth and turn in, and don’t run the town with flash
reefers again. You can’t do them any good, and they may
do you great harm. Cut away to bed, and tell Mr. Dorney
at breakfast that I hope to see him at nine in the morning
at the agent’s office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had dismissed the boy, Sard walked back to the
Plaza, to think. He sat again at his table, sipping coffee,
while the waiters about him prepared for closing time.
“Medellin throat,” he kept thinking, “dead of medellin
throat; Captain Cary dead and the ship thrown away on
the Snappers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came the tramp of feet upon the stairway: men
were marching to the Plaza crying strange cries like cheers.
The waiter at his elbow touched him and muttered under
his breath “Cuidado.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard looked up suddenly. Men in the green and silver
uniforms of the Guards came up the staircase into the
Plaza: they drew up in three little squads of four men
each. They carried rifles with which they stood on the
alert. After them marched two officers, who came to
Sard, jingled the spurs on their heels, clicked and saluted.
Sard rose, returned the salute and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Chisholm Harker?” one of the men said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Harker, not Captain,” Sard answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His Excellency, Don Manuel, the Dictator, desires to
speak with you.” They jingled, clicked, saluted and went.
A great man stepped from the stairs into the Plaza. Sard
knew him at once; indeed no one could fail to know him;
there being only one such man alive. He was a grand man,
with beauty and power in every line and gesture. He was
dressed in spotless white and girt with a green sash. He
wore the great white Santa Barbara hat of white macilento
straw. He stood still, surveying Sard, for half a minute;
Sard stood bareheaded surveying him. Very slowly and
reverently the Dictator removed his hat, bowed to Sard
and stood bareheaded before him. He said no word, but
stood there bowed. Sard wished that it might end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dictator advanced suddenly and spoke in English
with fierce interjections of Spanish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Por Dios, Captain Harker,” he said, “I have
waited all these years, knowing that you would come.
When I heard that you were ashore and at the Plaza I
could hardly endure to wait. So, give me your hands:
no: both hands: so: how are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard mumbled that he was well and glad to see the
Dictator well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” the Dictator said, “I am better than when last
we met. You remember the time we met, on board the
<span class='it'>Venturer</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Your Excellency.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, too, I do not forget. Listen, all of you; this man is
one of those who saved me in the <span class='it'>Noche Triste</span>. I was
ruined: I was a beggar, what? Love killed, ay de mi;
friends killed, hope killed. Myself wounded, exhausted.
Those swinery had a price upon my head: two thousand
English pounds. These men in the <span class='it'>Venturer</span> they took me
in; they defended me. Those swinery were rowing harbour-guard
for me. These men in the <span class='it'>Venturer</span> drew me half
drowned from the sea and stood between me and death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused for a moment muttering words which were
customary with him when moved: some were prayers for
Carlotta, the rest curses on her killers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he muttered, “the swinery; but they paid with
their life’s blood, all but that dog, Don José, and that dog,
Rafael. They wetted those stones of horror with their
tears, those swinery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a boy in the <span class='it'>Venturer</span>,” he continued,
“what you call reefer, in what you call the half deck. He
brought me in the dusk a suit of serges and a shirt and
said, ‘Better luck next time, Señor.’ What was that
reefer’s name? Hey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard growled that reefers generally answer to the name
of Smith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not this one,” Don Manuel said. “Por Dios, Captain
Harker, it was you did that charity, you, then a boy. In
the dusk, you remember, by the deckhouse, under the
chocks of the boats, I know not the right name of it: you
remember? Por Dios, I remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, yes, por Dios; never will I forget. £2,000
to give me up, and I all in rags and bloody and shaking,
with nothing but my personal charm, what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay de mi, one is slow in being grateful, too slow; but
always in life the present is so full, the past drops, fades.
I have watched for all old <span class='it'>Venturers</span>. I read all ships’
papers for names. I have watched and waited for you.
‘Everything comes to him who waits,’ you say. Many
things come; not everything; some things come not
again. Ah, Harker, youth comes not again; thank God,
what? Dead love comes not again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was silent for a full half minute, thinking of the dead
love. When he spoke again it was very gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dead love comes not again, Harker mio. You
never saw her, Carlotta mia. That was where they killed
her, so some say: others say there: I shall never know.
She was not like me, one of power, but one of exquisite life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lopez, Jorge, Zarzas and Don Livio. Jorge, whom they
called Pluma Verde, and that other dog, El Cuchillo. Ha,
those woman-killers, they repented. Listen. Lopez cut
his veins in prison, but not enough: no, he was alive. He
and El Cuchillo and Pluma Verde and Zarzas and Don
Livio they all came up those stairs on their knees and
kissed where she died before they were shot. Ay de mi,
Carlotta mia, pobrecita. It was sweet, but it did not bring
her back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is with me now as with the slave: I work that I may
not think. God prisons us all in sorrow of some sort, so
that we may seek our escapes. I seek, now, only one
escape. Don José’s throat in my hands, and Rafael’s
throat in my teeth; then, then, then will she be paid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Harker mio, old <span class='it'>Venturer</span>, my great kind benefactor,
I want such men as you. This Santa Barbara is great,
great; there is no place like it on earth: only I want men:
I have brains, plenty, but only two hands. I want hands
like yours. Will you join me? Choose your work, what
say you, and be with me. What would you like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to congratulate you, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for? My fortune?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, your gratitude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was pleased with the answer. “Ha, yes,” he said,
“the ingratitude of a king. But it is often hard to be
grateful to individuals: it is easier to be grateful to the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see you are not married, Harker. You, too, have
sorrowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is now early. I have to rise early to a special
Mass at our friends of Santa Alba yonder. I shall have but
a short watch below. Come, then, Harker mio, to coffee
with me at seven, at the palacio; you will have thought,
then, what we may do together. So, then, I shall expect
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took Sard’s hands and shook them; then he stood
back, as though stepping away from the life that he enjoyed
into the loneliness of monarchy. Majesty seemed to come
upon him like a garment; for the purple, like other habits,
may be assumed. His guards clicked, saluted, and fell in.
They were all men from Encarnacion, from the old Encinitas
estate, where they showed as relics a hoof of Alvarado’s
horse, set in silver, the sword of Vasco Nuñez, and a piece
of the script of the Gospel of St. John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed down the marble stairs, uttering the cries
which Sard had heard as they came up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They cheer the dead, Señor,” the waiter explained,
“they cheer the Heroic Five and Señora Jennings and the
Pobrecita, whose images they pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bells chimed for one in the morning: all shops and
cafés in the Plaza closed. The waiters came from within,
dressed in their old coats, with turned-up collars; their
feet passed away, some to the old town, some to the north,
till the town was almost silent. A cat or two went stealthily
or swiftly across the Plaza. A little brown owl flew across
crying a note that was querulous and sad. Out in the
harbour, some watchman whose clock was slow made two
bells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard stayed in his chair, wondering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no wish to sleep: he only wanted a new direction
for his life. He was going to strike at life until he found
one. “I will stay here,” he thought, “till I can see what
I can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had thought of many ways of life as desirable, after
he had once held command at sea. Now his old desire of
command was gone. He wanted no more of the sea, but
to come ashore and begin anew, without any dreams to
mislead him, nothing but the work to do and the honour to
earn from it. Why should he not come ashore, to bear a
hand under Don Manuel? Great things were being done
there: a great state was rising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thinking over all this, he had the fancy that someone,
or rather not someone, something, was watching him from
the central House of Sorrow. It became more than fancy
with him that something evil, like a vast black cat, was
watching him there. He turned to the house, to face it,
whatever it was, but could see nothing there, save the green
verandah, the windows blank and sightless, the walls
morphewed with scaling. Then the central door opened,
a man came out, locked the door behind him and then
stood surveying the Plaza. As Sard was the only person
there, he stared at Sard, who stared back. He was a
shortish, very strongly made man, with the rangey boss
movement of a young bull on pasture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something dangerous about him. He tossed
his head back, which flashed his earrings and emphasised
the raffish sideways cock of his hat. There was something
familiar about him: he reminded Sard of that “flash
townee,” Sumecta, who had sat with Mr. Wiskey at the
boxing-match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man strode off the doorstep on to the pavement.
He gave his hat a further cock, still staring at Sard, almost
with challenge, then he pulled a coloured handkerchief
from a side pocket and blew his nose at Sard. As he drew
the handkerchief something glimmered out with it and
fell into the dust of the gutter. The man was plainly
Sumecta, and the blowing of the nose was as the range-bull’s
bellow at a rival. Sard tilted back his chair to watch him.
Sumecta advanced to Sard, who waited for him, humming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re out here kind of late,” Sumecta said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sumecta sharpened his tone. “Have you got a match?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” There was a pause: the two men watched each
other. Presently Sumecta said: “Can I have the match?
I’d like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard went on with his humming but kept an eye lifting
lest some other waif of the night should come. Sumecta
took a half-step nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For two pins,” he said, “I’d bash your face in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard went on humming, but drew two pins from the
lapel of his coat and offered them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’you mean?” Sumecta said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two pins. There was going to be bashing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a funny dog, aren’t you?” Sumecta said. He
edged away from Sard but kept his eyes upon him. He
had the flash cock to his hat, a mouth with a tooth gone
and a swollen nose. He edged away with his eyes on Sard
till he was off the Plaza and going down the stair. Sard
edged his chair a little round so that he might follow
Sumecta as he went. When Sumecta was out of sight
Sard swiftly and silently stepped aside in case Sumecta
should rush back for a sudden shot. But no shot came,
Sumecta was gone: his steps were dying away. Sard was
alone again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being alone, he stepped swiftly to where the glimmering
thing had dropped into the gutter. As he had expected, it
was a door key: he picked it up. “If he had been reasonably
polite,” he said to himself, “he should have had it.
As it is, he shall do without it. And now, if I’m to be at
the palace at seven I had better be off to turn in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had pocketed the key and turned to the head of the
stair on his way to bed, when he heard someone hurrying
to the stair-foot. For the moment, he judged that it was
Sumecta come back to shoot him, but a glance showed that
it was a much younger, slighter man. He came running
up the stairs, looked about the Plaza for someone, and
hailed Sard with: “Oh, your Excellency?” It was
Hilary Kingsborough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His Excellency has gone, Mr. Kingsborough,” Sard
said. “He has been gone about half an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse,” the young man said. “But who are you who
know my name? O, you are the Mr. What’s-his-name,
who warned me that night. Where has His Excellency
gone, do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back to the palace to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse. They told me there that I should find him here.
I’ve been hunting for him and just missing him ever since I
landed at ten o’clock. I must find him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard was struck by the high, shrill, feverish excitement
of the young man’s speech; his face was gaunt and
burning: his body wasted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me come with you,” Sard said, “I’ll find you a
cab, I’m afraid you’re ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ill?” he said. “This thing is tearing me to pieces.
Those devils shot me and took my sister. And I can’t find
her, Mr., sir, no one can find her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she was found,” Sard said. “She was found at
Tlotoatin. I read it in the paper here, only a few hours
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The paper was a damned lie,” the young man cried.
“She isn’t found. We’ve no trace nor track of her. Good
God, they are all in it, police, press, politicians, and I
can’t get a word of truth, nor any clue of where she is. You
said that they talked of Santa Barbara? For the love of
God, now Mr. What’s-your-name (I can’t remember
names), those devils whom you overheard, tell me the truth
now, they said they were coming here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Kingsborough,” Sard said, “they did. What is
more, one of the men, whom I overheard, came out of that
door not ten minutes ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? You’ll swear that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t swear. He did. He went down those stairs,
you must almost have met him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then Margarita may be in that house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think that that can be,” Sard said. “It’s not
very likely, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Likely?” Hilary cried. “What is likely? She has
disappeared and every power, here and in the Occidental,
is behind the swine who took her. I’ve come here to see
the Dictator, and I want you to see him, too, Mr., sir. Tell
him that you know that they are a Santa Barbara gang
and that he must find her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right I will,” Sard said. “I was to see him in a
few hours’ time, but I will go to him at once instead. Only
look here, Mr. Kingsborough, I have seen this Dictator.
Since I have landed I have seen both himself and his police
service. It is hardly credible or possible that Miss Kingsborough
could have been brought here without the fact
coming to his knowledge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what I am saying,” Hilary said, “he is in it,
with the gang, and so I’ll tell him to his face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Kingsborough, he is not that kind of man. Be
assured, he is one who will help you in every way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will,” Hilary said. “Why did his filthy press print
that lie, that she is found? He is in this rum-smuggling
business, as everybody knows. He is in the smugglers’
power; he has to let them do what they please. My sister
may be in that house: very likely is! Well, I am going
in, to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait just for one minute, Mr. Kingsborough,” Sard
said. “You’ve been shot, you say; you are still ill.
We have a Minister here who will have that house laid
bare for us almost within the hour. We will find a cab
and drive to the Embassy and have the house searched in
the proper manner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The proper manner,” Hilary said. “I don’t know of
any proper manner with blackguards of this sort. Why
should you try to keep me from saving my sister, you might
be one of the gang yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard was about to answer soothingly, seeing the young
man’s distress and nervous exhaustion, but as he opened
his lips there came the cry of a woman from within the
central house. It was the cry of one in despair. It
rang out clearly and fully for an instant, then was stopped
suddenly as by a blow or a gag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You heard that?” Hilary said. “That was my sister’s
voice. She is inside there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen a moment,” Sard said, “wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to wait,” Hilary answered. “Wait for
what? Till they’ve killed her?” He was half-way to the
door, when Sard stopped him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” Sard said, “this may be the key of this
door; the man dropped it. We’ll go in, if it is. Are you
armed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Sard said, “but I’m used to rough houses. Are
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Sard said, “there’s only one rule in rough
house fighting, and that is, be first. Come on.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crept to the door of the house. It looked more
solid, close at hand. It had knopped iron plates across it:
the fanlight was barred: the windows to each side were
covered with old iron rejas. The house behind it was as
silent as the grave. For a moment Sard thought of calling
a civil guard, but put the thought from him, “I’m my
own civil guard in a seaport town; besides, this gang is
certain to have squared the police.” Both men listened:
Sard tried the key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The key fitted and turned. Very gently, lest the door
should be upon a chain, Sard moved it ajar. He peered in.
There was a smell of some gum or incense, like the smell of
sweet leather. There was an ample hall, dark as old
leather, with patches of light from the windows. He saw
then what he had not suspected from without, that the
windows were of an opaque glass. He edged into the hall,
followed by Hilary. They stood together, inside the door,
listening intently. Sard felt along the door to make sure
how to open it. “It’s a latch door,” he whispered.
“We’d better close it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, keep it open for our retreat,” Hilary whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too risky,” he answered. “It might slam to, or be
noticed from outside, or make a draught that would be
noticed inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better have a line of escape,” Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll prop it, then,” Sard said. “Or will you stand
guard while I explore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No fear,” Hilary answered, “I’m going to find my
sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, then,” Sard said. “We’ll prop it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a mat just within the door. He lifted an
edge of this so that it kept the door pressed to, but not
shut. Hilary took a step into the room and stumbled on
the well of the mat. He gasped out “God!” and then
shook with a laugh which was noiseless but hysterical.
His stumble crashed in that stillness like a shot. Sard
squeezed his arm to steady him: then they both listened:
then Hilary whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear a sort of scratching noise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard heard it too, and thought, at first, that it was the
fidgeting of feet, then made sure that it was not that, nor
yet the brushing of leaves upon a window, but some noise
which he could not yet explain: it might be nothing but
the breeze upon a ventilator. It was a constant flutter
somewhere to their left; it came no nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” Hilary muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seconds out of the ring,” Sard answered. “Come on,
now. Time.” He could see almost nothing. He groped
about the hall. It was soft to the feet with a closely-woven
grass matting. He moved eight paces to his right
and touched a wall or screen of wood: “wood panelling,”
he decided. It ran from the front of the house into the
house: it seemed to be the boundary wall of the hall on
that side. He groped along it to the end, but found no
door, nor any break in the panelling. A table stood near
this wall; it bore a metal tray containing a visiting card
nearly as big as a postcard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard took the card and listened. He heard Hilary at a
little distance breathing like a roaring horse. Sard wished
that he would make less noise with his breathing. He
crept across to him and told him so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re snorting like a horse yourself,” Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you found any door?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. There’s no door on this side. Only a row of
pegs for hats and a rack for whips, but the whips are gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it all panelling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, panelling; with two chairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The door will be at the back then,” Sard said. “Come to
this wall at the back. What is that thing on the wall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like a painting,” Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a painting,” Sard said, “but the paint is running
on it. And it doesn’t smell like paint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there no door?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None. None that I can see,” Sard whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see,” Hilary answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He peered close to the wall and groped along it with his
fingers. There seemed to be no door there. It was
panelling, as at the sides. High up in the centre of it was
a trophy of a horned beast’s head: it looked like a giant
goat’s head; something odd had been done to it. The
smell of sweet leather was much stronger at that end of the
hall. There were figures painted on the panels, at both
sides of the trophy. The paint was trickling down the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Someone has been burning carib leaf,” Hilary whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There must be a door,” Sard whispered back. “Only
it is let in flush with the panels. We must strike a light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead then,” Hilary muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that instant there came a little suck of air, Sard’s
propping gave way before it, the hall door shut to with a
crash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, you are a pearl of a door-fastener,” Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! Watch for a light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They watched; but no light showed and no sound came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody stirring,” Sard said; “the breeze is rising.
We must leave the door. Look there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man looking in at the window at us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can he see us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not possibly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he a civil guard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not wearing a helmet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think he can be coming in here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He would come in if he belonged here. There,
he has gone. He was only some passer-by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an odd time of morning for a passer-by,” Hilary
said. “There. It is striking two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” Sard said, stooping down; “I’ve guessed
the secret of this wall. It has no door; but it slides in
grooves to and fro. They seem to have oiled the runners.
I’m going to strike a light to see which way the thing runs.
Hold this twine: it is tarry. I’ll light it. It will make a
candle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took a small hank of roping twine, lit it and held it to
the wall. “Look here,” he said, “at what is on my hands:
blood. This which I thought was oil is blood. There can
be no doubt of that. They have spattered blood all over
this wall here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have killed her, then!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not they. This is not the blood of a murder,” Sard
said. “Look, it is splashed high up on the wall. It has
been flung from a cup at those images.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was undoubtedly so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This seems to be a pretty devilish place,” Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will shame the devil before we leave it. Now come
here, behind me, Mr. Kingsborough; dig your fingers
into this panel; that’s you. Now, heave; heave and
start her; oh, heave! handsomely, handsomely; she is
moving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heavy panel of the wall slowly slid away to their
right. A waft of the smoke of burning carib leaf came into
their faces, so that they tasted rather than smelled it. It
was sickly to taste and dizzying to breathe. Sard stopped
heaving at the panel and peered into the opening which
they had made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were looking into a large room, which ran further
back (that is, away from the Plaza front) than they had
expected. There were some upright things, they could
not see what, in the middle of the room; all very dim. To
the right of these there was a brazier glowing faintly with
charcoal on which carib leaf had been crumbled. Sard,
who was nearest to the opening, felt at once that there was
somebody there. His dream of the mountains came back
to him with a shock. He called in a low voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Kingsborough!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice from the middle of the room answered faintly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Margarita!” Hilary cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is tied to these uprights,” Sard said, as he pushed
into the room. He could dimly see that she was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Miss Kingsborough,” he said, “we will soon
have you out of here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m here, Margarita,” Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard reached back for his knife, which he had replaced at
San Agostino. It was a small but very strong sheath-knife
without a guard. Margarita spoke from her stake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, be careful, Hilary! There are Indians here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, dear,” Hilary said. “We’ve found you now.
We won’t let the Indians hurt you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord,” Sard said, “she is chained and padlocked
as well as tied. Never mind, Miss Kingsborough, we will
set you free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the chain, so as to bend the hasp of the padlock,
but it was beyond his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you a hairpin, Miss Kingsborough; perhaps I
can pick this lock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said. As he felt along the stake, he found her
hair all loose about her. He felt the foot of the stake. It
was an unbarked bole of a tree dug deep into the earth and
tamped well home. She was chained to it at waist and
ankles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catch hold of the stake, Mr. Kingsborough,” Sard said.
“We may be able to heave it right out. Sway with us,
Miss Kingsborough. We will give the word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and Hilary got their arms about the stake and hove
and hove again, with no more result than to make the stake
tremble: it was like trying to pull down a growing tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll save you, Margarita,” Hilary kept saying. Sard
could not clearly see how they could save her without a cold
chisel and a mallet. He struck a match and lit another
twist of twine, which burned for nearly forty seconds. He
saw Margarita’s white face and great eyes, a strange room
of a triangular shape, with a throne at the apex, another
bole or tree, a few feet from them, but nothing which could
serve as a weapon or a tool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” he said, “I must fetch in the police. Here’s
my knife, Mr. Kingsborough. You stay here on guard
while I run out and fetch some guardias.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll all be bribed,” Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No police can be bribed to this point,” Sard answered.
“I’ll have them here in three minutes. Cheer up, Miss
Kingsborough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He listened: all was still in the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” he said, “I’ll be back in five minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hated leaving them, but there was nothing for it. A
piece of carib leaf settled in the brazier with a little sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go then,” he said. “Look out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crept out of the room and across the hall. When he
was near the door, he stumbled on something which had
not been there on his first journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he stumbled forward over it, he heard Margarita call,
“Look out, Hilary; the Indians!” He heard Hilary
gasp, as though struck, and cry out, “Ah! would you?”
At the same instant, as he himself rose from the floor of the
hall, someone most active tackled him from behind, with a
strangle-hold round the throat. He swung himself forward
and hove the strangler off his feet, but did not make him
loose his hold. He stumbled again on the thing on the floor
and someone came at him from in front. He hit out and
landed on a body, but somebody new caught him by the
right arm and gave it a twist which nearly broke it. He hit
one or two bodies and faces, but they were all Indians; it
was like punching india-rubber; they hissed their breath in
through their teeth and came on again. He reached the
door; he got hold of the latch, but the door would not open.
He got hold of the strangler’s arm and wrenched it against
the iron of the door. Then somebody thrust him sideways;
he stumbled on to somebody who was crouching;
then, immediately, he was down, with three or four of these
wild cats on top of him. In his rage at being brought down,
he hit hard, but they were too many and seemed to see in
the dark. He was mastered, bound, blindfolded and gagged.
Then a couple of them picked him up like a sack and ran him
along into the inner room. A man asked in good Spanish,
“If the lad were dead?” An Indian replied, “That he still
breathed.” They hove Sard against the upright bole.
Though he writhed, he was helpless: he felt like a storm
staysail made up for bending; they chained him there.
He heard Margarita wail. Then an Indian—perhaps the
man whom he had wrenched against the iron—hit him hard
in body and face again and again and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he stopped, and there was silence, save for a
rustling, as though snakes were gliding away. Then a light
appeared, someone laughed with satisfaction and twitched
the bandage from Sard’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard saw before him the Father Garsinton who had asked
for a passage in the <span class='it'>Pathfinder</span>. It was he, unmistakably,
but changed indeed. He now wore a scarlet robe wrought
with symbols, which gave him the appearance of a cardinal
of the Middle Ages. He gave to Sard the impression of an
overwhelming power devoted resolutely to the practice of
evil. There was cruelty in every line, with enormous
strength (and grace) to give the cruelty its part in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man snickered as he looked at his victims chained
to the trees before him. He walked a few yards to and fro
with his head up, smiling; he stretched his hands and a
light came into his eyes. It was exactly as though he
realised those gestures of freedom which would most hurt
his prisoners. The face had been made hard and evil by
the devil, but it had also been made tired. The flesh was
puckered at the eyes; there was some loose flesh forming
under the chin; the mouth was a shade out of condition.
The scarlet skull-cap no doubt hid hair beginning to be grey
or thin. The great want in the face was the want of horns
sprouting from the brow; with those he would have been
a complete devil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Sard said, “our friends know that we are here.
You had better let us go before they come to fetch us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You lie,” the man said. “Your friends do not know
that you are here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Dictator of this Republic knows that we are here,”
Sard ventured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Dictator of this Republic is my good friend,” the
man replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Consul is not; neither is my Minister,” Sard said.
“You will find this kidnapping trade a poor one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By our friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find night burglary and knight-errantry poor
trades, before your friends find you, young man. Who are
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undo these chains and I will show you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a sailor; an English sailor, who missed his
ship at Las Palomas,” the padre answered. “You are one
of these ship’s dogs who run loose in foreign ports. A slave
by day, a drunken criminal by night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Less of a criminal than a dirty, foreign, woman-torturer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take you burgling; in the fact, sailor. What is your
name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A better name than yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your name is Harker. My name is the Holy One.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you looked lousy enough for a saint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know the laws about burgling in this land?
We may kill burglars. We do kill them. Every day a
corpse of a burglar is flung out. You have seen such.
They are often sailors, unclaimed three days, then buried.
I just tell you now, that your corpse will be flung out of
here, in a little while, when I have finished with you. I
shall not keep you long, but it will be before your friends
come here, never fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better hurry up then,” Sard said, “for they
will be here in ten minutes. And you had better not boast
too much before witnesses of the crimes you plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stepped swiftly up to Sard and slapped his
cheek. When he tried to slap the other cheek, Sard, as a
boxer, was too quick; he snapped at the hand and bit it;
the man wrenched himself free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trapped rat bites,” he said. “Very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not seem to mind the bite, though it bled. He
seemed to pass into a state of contemplation in which the
body did not matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know what I am?” he asked. “I am the
priest of evil. This triangle in which you stand is the
temple of evil. These gallows posts to which you stand
are the altars of evil. I am going to offer mass to evil, of
bread and wine. Do you know what bread and what
wine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You drunken, dirty ass!” Sard said. “Mr. Kingsborough,
who was here with me, has raised the town by this.
You will be taken out, scrubbed with sand and canvas, and
then jailed; so hold on all with your folly and let us go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Kingsborough did not escape quite so easily, honest
sailor,” the Holy One replied. “We are Dagoes, as you
call them, here, not Englishmen; not Gringos; we are not
sentimental in our earnest. Mr. Kingsborough paid the
penalty of burglary. You, Madonna, lovely Margarita
Kingsborough, will tell you. You saw what happened to
your brother. Tell him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard him groan from a blow, Mr. Harker,” Margarita
said. “Then, when the lights went on, I saw him lying
dead on the floor; the Indians dragged him out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Correct,” the Holy One said. “He is dead. And you are
helpless. Your fleet can’t help you, nor your Minister, nor
your Consul, nor your State, nor any other of those things
you believe in. You are in the hands of power. You are
elements for power to sacrifice. You, man, are bread;
you, woman, are wine; and I shall sacrifice your bread and
wine, your blood and honour, your life and your chastity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew a dirty talker like you once before,” Sard said.
“He was a Portuguese babu on the mother’s side; his
father was the port of Goa. He fell into the slime once at
low tide; but even without that you could not tell him from
filth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I leave you to prepare yourselves,” the Holy One said.
“I go to prepare myself for communion with my god, the
god of evil, who will come down here, to eat of the bread
and drink of the wine.” His head went back as he spoke,
and his eyes lit up (they were light-brown rolling eyes) till
they were like the eyes of a beast that sees in the dark. He
began to pray as he stood; his head went even further
back, till they could hardly see his lips moving; then he
began to chant:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I am a body and a hand that wait</p>
<p class='line0'>Thy power, O Evil; use and make me great</p>
<p class='line0'>With lust and thirst for blood until I shine</p>
<p class='line0'>Like goat for rut, like wolf for murder, thine.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He moved off, swaying to the rhythm of his song, and
possessed by his thought: he turned to look at his captives
as he passed, but there seemed to be no speculation in his
eyes, only a glare, such as the petroleuses have, in their
eyes, in revolutions, in the days of frenzy. He passed out
of that door through which the body of Hilary had been
dragged. Sard reckoned that doors led out of the central
house into the houses on each side. He made the note in
his mind, “the man controls two houses; perhaps three;
there may be twenty or thirty of them, living here.”
The door clicked to behind the Holy One; Sard was alone
with Margarita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Harker,” she said, “does anybody know that you
are here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he answered. “It was false.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or that my brother was here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody knows. And it is my fault. I ought not to
have let your brother into this house without the police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We heard you cry out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cried because I saw that I was near the street,” she
said. “They were bringing me in here from inside there.
I hoped that someone might hear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We did hear. If we shout now, someone may hear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At this time in the morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is worth trying. Help! help! help!” he shouted.
“Police! Murder! Help us here! Help! help! help!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is useless,” she said. “When I cried, they drew the
doors across; these doors are sound-proof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us save our breath for the present,” he said. “The
streets are deserted now. We will shout later, when there
are more people stirring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not answer immediately; she thought and he
knew that she thought, that there might not be a “later”
for him. He put a strain upon his bonds to test them.
His legs were tightly lashed, his arms were secure; his body
was chained to the stake and that chain was racked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Harker,” Margarita said, “is there any chance of
the men of your ship coming to look for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, “next to none. My ship is lost. People
may enquire for me presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a silence Margarita asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did my brother say if the police were searching
for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, Miss Kingsborough, you are being sought
for everywhere, and the police have been warned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any faith in the police?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “indeed, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if the police are competent,” she said, “then how
do you account for our being as we are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wicked have their day,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was fearful lest this should be disheartening to her.
He hastened to add: “They will get you out of this, Miss
Kingsborough. I shall be asked and searched for at seven
o’clock, only five hours from now, by the Dictator himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What Dictator is that?” she asked. “Where is this
place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Santa Barbara,” he said. “The Dictator is Don
Manuel. Did you not even know where you are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have known nothing of where I have been since they
dragged me out of the house after you had warned us.
They put me into a boat and then into a ship, where I was
a prisoner for a fortnight. Sometimes we were at sea and
sometimes in anchorages. I knew from the sun that we
went south and west; nothing more than that. Then
three nights ago they landed me and wheeled me here,
bound, blindfolded and gagged, upon a stretcher in a sort
of ambulance. I knew from the noises and smells that we
were in a city. Someone stopped the people who were
bringing me and asked what was the matter. The woman
said, ‘She has had an accident, poor thing.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had women guards, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely there were some decent men among the smugglers
who were willing to help you: for instance, a man
called Douglas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only men whom I have met have been those who
carried me away out of the house, and those who are here,
the Indians and a terrible negro.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But about this man in red,” Sard said, “I know him
only as Father Garsinton; he seems to be the head of the
business; but what is his aim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He worships evil,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but what does he hope to gain by all this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To increase the power of evil in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he is not young,” Sard objected. “He is grown
up; he is even elderly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a devil,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard of boys in cities thinking these thoughts,”
Sard said, “but never grown men. And why does he
single out you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has always wanted me,” she said. “He always said
that he would have me. He told me years ago that to-night
should be the night: now it is. And now he has killed my
brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard her weeping and saw tears running down her
steady face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, no,” he said, “do not weep; do not cry like
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot help it,” she said. “I loved my brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He loved you too, dearly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were silent for some minutes, while Sard tried
again to shift his bonds. When he spoke again he had
good news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Kingsborough,” he said, “I have to break this
news to you. Your brother is not dead. He is alive.
He has just crept into the room behind you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t make any noise,” Hilary said. “For heaven’s
sake don’t make any noise. I’ve been knocked out. I’m
dizzy and sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came up between them and sat down upon the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Hilary,” she said, “you are covered with blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know, dear. O Lord, I do feel queer! They
have all gone upstairs, the people here. Cheer up, Pearl,
my darling, we’ll soon have you out of this. The only
question is, how to open the padlocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any keys?” Sard asked, “or anything like
wire for a pick-lock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, “I’m afraid I have nothing; nothing at
all.” He bowed himself forward where he sat and propped
his head in his hands; a few drops of blood trickled over
his fingers. Sard saw that he was on the brink of swooning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Kingsborough,” he said, “will you look about the
room for a wire or a tool or something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a moment, will you,” Hilary answered. “It’s
silly of me. I’m afraid I’m going to faint.” He fainted,
then came to himself, then saw the blood on his hands and
fainted again. Presently he hove himself up into a sitting
posture and said that he had never felt so sick in his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut your eyes,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you say ‘shut your eyes,’ but my head’s all gone.
I’m as sick as a cat. I say, would you mind bringing me
some water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bring you water,” Sard said. Margarita was
crying. “I’ll bring you lovely water. Only, you see,
your sister and I are locked up here, chained. We want
you to unchain us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I would,” he said. “But I cannot stand this smell
of incense. It takes all the strength clean out of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hilary,” Margarita said sharply, “Hilary, turn round.
Look at that shelf on the side of the wall there. Is not
that water in a glass jug there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is water,” Sard said. “Look, Mr. Kingsborough.
It is water. Get to the shelf and splash yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is water,” Hilary said. “I don’t know about
getting to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can get to it, Hilary dear,” Margarita said.
“Crawl to it and then you will reach it. Oh, well done,
Hilary; how splendid of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sick man crawled on hand and knees to the wall.
He leaned for a moment there and said, “I can’t reach it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rest and gather strength,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hilary,” his sister said, “crawl to that little table in
the middle of the room. You will be able to push that to
the wall and then climb to the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will,” Hilary said: “only I must wait for a
moment, for this sickness to pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stayed there huddled against the wall, with his eyes
shut, for two or three minutes. He looked liker a dead
man than a living. At last he moved forward from the
wall and slowly crawled to the table. The table was liker
a large old English stool than a table. When he reached it,
he drooped forward over it as though he would never have
the strength to rise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take your time,” Sard said. “Do not try to lift that
stool, but push it before you while you lean on it. So.
That is you. Not too big a push at a time: take it
quietly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I do feel so sick!” Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No wonder. You’ve had a bat on the head,” Sard
said. “You are a marvel to be moving at all, but go
handsomely; there’s always time; always lots of time;
no rushing. Now wait; rest; gather your strength
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited, leaning on the stool, while the others watched
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are nearly there,” Sard said. “One more little
effort and you will be there. I think your brother’s a
hero, Miss Kingsborough, to be doing this, in his state.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wonderful, Hilary,” she said. “Now forward
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sick man thrust the stool before him almost to the
wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop there,” Sard said. “Do not push it further
under the shelf. Now you are almost there: all that you
have to do now is to heave yourself up and reach the jug.
Steady yourself against the wall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary with an effort hove himself to a kneeling posture
on the stool. When there, he found that he had pushed
it too far underneath the shelf. He could not see the jug,
but saw instead that he would have to lean somewhat
backward, clutching to the shelf with one hand while he
groped for the jug with the other. The thought of doing
this unnerved him, he made no attempt for a minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is just directly over your head,” Margarita told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know where it is,” he answered, “only getting
it is the problem. However, it is water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is lovely water, which will take away all your
faintness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, by George, it will! I can tell you I want it. I’m
going to get it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. Well done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He steadied himself as cautiously as a tightrope-walker.
He placed one foot upon the stool, swayed, steadied, made
an effort, caught the rim of the shelf and stood there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid, Hilary! You’ve done it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s on a tray,” Hilary said. “I can’t reach the jug,
it’s too far in. But I’ve got hold of the tray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pull the tray towards you. There; it is coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now catch hold of the jug.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, take care, take care; mind, Hilary!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have the whole thing down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord!” Hilary said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his weakness, as the tray reached the edge of the
shelf, Hilary slipped, failed or fell. He tipped the tray
over as he dropped; there was a crash and a breaking of
glass and a gurgling of liquid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, you people,” Hilary said; “I was afraid
that that would happen. I’m too weak to do this kind of
thing: now it is gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, it is not,” Margarita said. “Wet your handkerchief
in it, then drink that, or mop your forehead with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well thought of,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” Hilary said, “this is not water: it is that
what’s-its-name, the white brandy these fellows drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drink some, drink some, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m drinking. I say. You may say what you like.
It makes me feel a different being.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splash your brows with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will. And I will save this. There’s about a tumblerful.
And, good Lord, I say, I say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? What have you found in the tray?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bunches of keys. Look here. Two bunches of keys.
I may be able to unlock your padlocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try your sister’s padlocks first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” Margarita said, “try Mr. Harker’s padlocks
first. He is a man. He can help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your sister first,” Sard said. “I’ll not be set free
first. And as for helping, I have not helped anyone, so
far as I can see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary tried the keys in the padlocks of his sister’s chains.
He tried eleven without success; then, at the twelfth, the
locks clicked back and the chains could be cast aside. She
was still bound to the pillar by a thong of hide. “I cannot
undo this knot,” Hilary said, “my fingers are too weak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gnaw it open with your teeth,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilary sat down and sipped some brandy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would not upset me,” he said. “I feel as
sick as a dog, and the very thought of taking this stuff in
my teeth is more than I can stand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry,” Sard said. “What you must do is, pick up a
piece of broken glass with a sharp edge and saw it through
with that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” Hilary said. “I can do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he bent to pick up the glass, it seemed to all three
there that men were muttering just beyond the doors.
They heard no words distinctly, but voices spoke, feet
shuffled: the noise, whatever it was, died away almost at
once: all was still again. Hilary sawed through the hide,
so that Margarita was free. She took the keys and began
to try them on the padlocks of Sard’s chains. She unlocked
his hand-chains with the third key, but could not fit the
leg-iron padlock until the last key of all. They cast loose
the last of the chains, Sard was free. He picked up the
chain, which was of a one-inch link, stopped a bight in it
for a handfast, made an overhand knot in each end, and
then swayed it to and fro. “Now we have some sort of a
weapon,” he said. “Now we will see whether we cannot
get out of here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pearl,” Hilary asked, “do you know whether we can
get out from here into any yard at the back of the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a yard at the back of the house; I have seen
it. There is a shed in it, with a great dog,” she said.
“But even if we reached the yard, it would not help.
There are houses beyond.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us keep to what we know,” Sard said. “We
know the way to the Plaza, and in the Plaza we may meet
people who will help us. We must slide these doors apart
and make for the front door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree,” Margarita said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Each have a sip of brandy,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They each took a sip, then took their bearings and
moved to the sliding door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The light is going out,” Hilary said. The light
suddenly dimmed to half its strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Sard said. “That means that it is half an
hour from dawn. They cut off the light at the power-house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was afraid that it meant that we were discovered,”
Margarita said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it,” Sard said. “It’s the custom in the
port. Now, Mr. Kingsborough, we’ll soon have you and
your sister out into safety. Catch hold of the door here.
Dig your nails into it. Quietly, now. Are you all
ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, when I give the word, heave back. All together,
now. Heave!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They hove: it trembled a little, but did not give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They hove again and again, but there was nothing for
them to catch hold of: they could only hold by the tips of
their fingers: the door trembled, but did not give. While
Sard searched for something that would give them a
purchase, the light went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t shift this panel,” Sard said; “we must try
this door at the side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened it and peered beyond it into a dimness in
which there was a flight of stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” he whispered. “There’s no one here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crept into the dimness. There was another door
beyond the staircase. They went through it into a darkness
in which they groped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Sard trod upon somebody, who caught him by
the leg. “Look out! Get back,” he cried. Somebody
grappled him as he spoke, so that he could not get back
with the others. A light suddenly shone out to show him a
big buck negro coming at him. An Indian, who had him
round the hips, brought him to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard shook himself free, rose to his feet, hit somebody
hard, and at once was clinched by the big negro. “You’ve
not got me yet,” he said. He hit him on the ribs and
kicked his shins; the negro got him by the throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got yuh, honey,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indian whom he had kicked aside, caught him by
the leg again. By a violent effort he flung himself free,
and hit the negro on the jaw. The negro grunted, ducked
and came on: two or three Indians leaped in, like cats.
Sard hit one over the heart, so that he fell, then the others
got him down, and snarled and spat over him, and called
him evil names. They trussed him up as before with
strips of hide. The negro held him by the throat while
they did it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got yuh, honey,” he kept saying. “I sure got yuh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he was lashed up like a hammock, the negro slung
him over his shoulder. An Indian, the man whom he had
knocked down, followed just behind, digging Sard in the
legs at each step with the point of a knife. The negro
carried Sard back to the temple and chained him to the
pillar from which he had escaped. Two Indians came up
to Sard and pricked him with their knives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gringucho!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hay que matarle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, hay que.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hijo de puta.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the negro carried Margarita into the room and
chained her to her pillar. When he had done this, he lit a
cigar and puffed the smoke into her face; then thrust his
face into hers, and said, “Ah love de white woman,” and
kissed her. Then he looked at Sard, blew some cigar-smoke
into his face, and said, “Yuh hit me on de jaw. Bimeby
I come back and buhn yo eyes out with my segah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this he and the Indians disappeared, closing a door
behind them. Father Garsinton entered from the angle
of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was dressed in his scarlet robes and carried a lamp,
which he placed upon the low stool from which Hilary had
reached the jug. He then went to a small aumbry, drew out
some dried carib leaves and flung a few upon the brazier.
The stuff sputtered and threw out profuse smoke, the smell
of which was both sickly and stupefying. He seemed to
breathe it with pleasure. At last he turned to his victims,
looked from one to the other, and spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” he said. “My mice. The cat has played with
you. And did you taste the pleasures of hope? Did you
feel safe at last? Know, my little mice, that I watched,
while you hoped. So you would not try the back yard,
because of the dog? Why, the dog is stuffed. And so the
Dictator will search for Mr. Harker? That is to be expected,
but he will not search here, where so much of his
wealth is planned for. Still, you enjoyed your little hopes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew nearer and seemed in some strange way to grow
bigger. It was as though the evil which he served had
entered into him and taken possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” he said, “put by hope. Evil is stronger
than hope; or faith; or charity; or strength, you; or
honour, madam. What do you say, sailor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I had you with my hands free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! What would happen then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cleaner world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cleaner?” Sagrado said. “A cleaner world? My
friend, I serve the purpose of this world, which is not cleanliness,
but triumph. You, with your cleanliness, wasting
the energy of men in being clean. Pah, you two sickening
things; one clean, the other chaste. Which of you does
the more harm, with your beastly ideals?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had a man in the fo’c’sle once,” Sard said, “who
spoke just the same kind of thing; only there was some
excuse for him; he’d been brought up in a brothel. The
men took him on deck and scrubbed his mouth out with
sand and canvas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not use those methods,” Sagrado said. “But I
have my own methods of correcting false philosophers, as
you shall see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned, almost immediately, with something tied in
a native frail. He laid it upon the floor, then brought
the small table or stool and placed it facing the two victims,
between them and about one yard from each of them.
They could see the carib leaves in the brazier glowing and
unglowing and writhing like live things on the charcoal.
Then Sagrado unlaced the native frail and drew from it a
shell-shaped bomb, which he placed upon the table. He
adjusted the fuse with great care and then turned to his
victims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fifth part of an hour,” he said, “is twelve minutes.
In twelve minutes, precisely, this bomb will explode. It
contains a quarter charge, which will suffice. What the
bomb leaves, I and my ministrants will then take, to the
utmost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lit a twist of bijuco bast in the brazier, and then with
the flame set fire to the fuse. It burned for one second,
then changed to a glow, as Sagrado softly blew upon it.
It glowed rather redly and the glow showed a black mark
which at once began to creep, though very, very slowly,
along the unburned fuse. Sagrado blew out his lamp and
disappeared out of the room. The two victims saw nothing
but the veins in the leaves in the brazier and the black mark
charring along the fuse in front of the fire which charred it.
Already a small piece of white ash, like a cigar-ash, fell from
the burnt end of the fuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not look at that fuse,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot help it,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you can help it. Look at me. Can you move at
all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly at all. Can you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me the truth,” she said. “Do you think they
killed my brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not see,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose they will kill him. And I suppose this bomb
will kill us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must injure us,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long have we, before it bursts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten and a half minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supposing one of us should escape?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had better have no false hopes,” he said. “We’re
not likely to leave this house alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I meant only this,” she said: “the survivor might take
a message. Is there any message that you would care to
trust me with?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might explain to my aunt, old Lady Crowthorne,
in England. Would you care to trust any message to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To my brother, if he be alive,” she said; “and to my
father—he is really my stepfather—Hardy Kingsborough,
of Passion Courtenay, in Berkshire. Can you remember
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Passion Courtenay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Why? Do you know it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think I do,” he said. “I’ve gone there
every year, when I have been in England, for the last fifteen
years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With whom do you stay, then? Oh, this is happy, to
hear of home now, here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not stay,” he answered. “As a rule I go over
for the day, and then away in the evening. You see, I know
nobody there, now: in a way I never did. I go to the inn
near the river, the Hunt and Hounds; then I go on the
river, and away by the evening train, the 7.13.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect we have passed each other,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely,” he said. “Whereabouts do you live
there, Miss Kingsborough? Could you describe it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. For the last ten years we have lived at The
Murreys, which you may not know, but must have seen, if
you have been to the Hunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the outside of your home very well, then,” he
said. “It’s called The Murreys from the mulberry trees.
Whenever I go on the river there, I land in one of the fields
below your house and walk from the river to your garden
wall. The field is called Bridger’s Peace; do you know
why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means the piece of ground where the bridgers
camped when they built the bridge in the fourteenth
century.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought it was the other kind of peace,” he said, “the
‘Peace which passeth all understanding’; which it has
always been to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a beautiful place,” she said; “and the thought of
it is peace now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is going on, now,” she said, “under this same night;
the water is going on under the bridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, to be tied,” he cried, “lashed foot and hand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you land in our field?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The field is mixed up with my life; I have to go there.
In a way, that field and house have been all my life. The
sea has only been something to wrestle with: that is not
enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have the house and field been to you, then?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be mean not to share with my companion,”
Sard said; “you are linked with the place too. It is all
strange, and your being here at the end is almost the
strangest: you, the owner of that place, and I, just the
trespasser and worshipper. Fifteen years ago I was taken
to a picnic there. I don’t believe in chance. But it seemed
just chance that I went there. We didn’t know the people,
but they wanted a boy to fill up a side at cricket. Anyhow,
I went. Some people called Penga took me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I was quite out of it. I was the youngest there.
They had two elevens without me, and I didn’t know a soul
there, except Dick Penga, and he had had the swot of
bringing me and thought me a child, besides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a Spanish lady, a widow, there with her
daughter, who was of my own age. She was out of
it too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could always talk Spanish, so I talked to the girl. In
a way, we were children; but it was not any childishness
to me. That girl altered my life. She has been my life ever
since, all the life that mattered: the rest was only ropes
and weights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw her again, then?” Margarita said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said. “I’ve never seen her since, nor heard
from her. You see, she was only there by as strange a
chance, almost, as I. She came from Santo Espirito, in
Andaluz, in Spain. I wrote to her there, but I never had
an answer: of course, she would never have written to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went to Santo Espirito as soon as I could; but that
was eight years later. Nobody knew of them there. The
place had all changed in the interval, for they had begun to
work copper there: it was a mining town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was the girl’s name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Juanita de la Torre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you know her again, do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought that you were she when I saw you at that
window at Los Xicales.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am she,” she said simply. “I am Juanita de la Torre.
My mother married my stepfather the year of the picnic.
He met her at the picnic for the first time. Four years
later we went to live at The Murreys. We took the name
Kingsborough when mother married: we’ve been brought
up as English ever since. Margarita is my second name; I
took to that, because the English cannot pronounce the
other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can, Juanita. Ah! no, no! do not look at that fuse.
I will tell you when to prepare. We still have four minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you tell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve kept watches nearly every day and night for ten
years. I can tell time within a minute or two. And to
think that we met at Los Xicales and never knew! I was
misled by your name. Why did you not speak? You
heard my name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember I did not know your name,” she said. “I
have always thought that your name was Chisholm. I
never once heard you called Harker. You were Chisholm
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! I was afraid of that,” he said. “You never got
my letter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were silent for a few seconds; in the stillness some
ash dropped from the fuse with a feathery fall: down in the
town a cock crowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange,” he said. “There is a cock crowing. I
cannot hear a cock without knowing that I have an
immortal soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a live cry,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is like a trumpeter trumpeting the graves open. It’s
the cry the dead will rise with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” he cried, bitterly. “And the living are rising
with it, and going out to their work, while we are lashed
here like staysails. Oh, if I could only heave this pillar
down!” He swayed from side to side, but was too tightly
lashed: there was no stirring that tree bole tamped in four
feet below the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no good,” he said. “I am caught. And if I had
not been a hasty fool, I could have come here with guardias
and set you free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t think that for an instant,” she said. “They
were going to cut my throat if there were any rescue. ‘We
shall all die together,’ he told me. It’s death to him to
be caught here, but he was determined that I should die
first. Guardias would not have saved me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t done much,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have done everything,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red glow on the fuse suddenly changed to yellowish;
a little flame sprang up out of the glow: it wavered like a
candle-flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The thing is going to explode,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, it is bad fuse: it is burning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long have we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps less than a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you sing something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flame in the fuse suddenly brightened and lit up the
room. He turned to Margarita and saw her great eyes fixed
upon his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes the burst,” he said. “Stand by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flame steadied, then began to shoot higher with a
steady sputtering hiss till it was a foot high and scattering
sparks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your eyes tight shut,” he said. “And remember
it may just as easily cut our chains as us. Here she comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flame changed its colour to a dull red, which smoked;
it sputtered more loudly, then lessened, sank down and
went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait,” Sard said, “wait: it may be a delayed fuse.”
He counted up to seventy-three, slowly. “No,” he said.
“The fuse has failed: it is not going to explode.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light appeared at the door at the apex of the room:
Sagrado came in and looked at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First the pleasures, then the miseries of hope,” he said,
“to make the victims despair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do not despair,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not?” Sagrado answered. “No; perhaps
not yet. But you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A butcher’s sponge, like you, won’t make me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man would be unclean,” Sard said, “even for spitting
at you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unclean?” Sagrado answered. “There are various
conceptions of cleanliness, but all have to do with consecrations
and devotions. I am called unclean by you, who
serve men, who are a servant in a ship. Other flunkeys
serve the state. I am myself, unspotted from these flunkeydoms
and slaveries. If I serve, I serve evil, the master of
this world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is something,” Sard said, “to have a master as dirty
as the servant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is much,” Sagrado answered, “to have a power
commensurate with your philosophy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not seen any power in you yet,” Sard
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No?” Sagrado said. “Yet I stand free, while you are
bound, you and your romantic one. Which of us has the
power, Margarita?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has,” she answered. “And you know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know it,” he said, “nor do events show it.
I wanted you in my hands by a certain day: there was
nothing that you wanted less. Yet you came to my hands,
to the very moment planned. This sailor, or second
mate, if I understand him, has wanted you for fifteen years:
there was nothing that you wanted more, if I overheard
correctly. Are you in his hands, or arms, or in mine?
Which of us has the power over you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has,” she said. “And you know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will not see truth, you must learn truth; and
you too, my sailor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, as I understand it,” he said, turning to Sard,
“were for saving her from danger in Las Palomas. Did
you save her? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you save your ship from danger? Why, do you
suppose, did I go in your ship amid all that I most despise?
<span class='it'>Your</span> ship, I say, but I mean your owner’s ship, which you
were bought to keep afloat: you, a man, being slave to a
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The thing obeyed its slaves,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a while,” the Holy One said. “For a while it
gave satisfaction; the slaves earned a dividend for their
employers. But then I came, I, the Holy One, who am
appointed by my Master to bring down all this order which
he most loathes. I came to that ship to lay her low, as an
offence, and to smite her brains with numbness. They
were slave-brains, thinking of nothing but of keeping their
prisons clean. Their one joy was the pothouse, their sole
art the music-hall; their religion, what was that, you, who
reckon yourself their leader?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their religion is to risk their lives and mortify their
flesh in order to bring bread to their fellows,” Sard said.
“In doing that, they make iron swim and dead-weight skim
and the dead thing to be beautiful. Show me a finer
religion, you who are already carrion for the want
of one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They had no religion,” Sagrado answered. “They
were slaves who made pennies for pot-houses while their
work made pounds for peers. I, the Holy One, came among
them, and scattered among them the seeds of terror.
Would that you had been there, my second mate, to watch
that terror growing; the geraniums, the birds, then one by
one the brains; I, with a little drug, putting my hand on
the heart of your so boasted machine. It was a work of
art, my second mate, a symphony of horror. I drew out
what notes I wished, I struck what chords I loved, and the
instruments which I disliked, I destroyed. Your Cary, I
destroyed. I numbed him and killed him. With my own
dose, in his own stronghold, I gave him Death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You weren’t allowed to bury him,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a shot which went home. Plainly, the burial
of Captain Cary by the murderer in the priest’s clothes
would have given a relish to the crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter,” the Holy One answered, controlling his
face, “I shall bury you, when I have done with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t done with me yet,” Sard said. “And I
owe you for Captain Cary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your owners owe me for the ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I may pay that too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sagrado walked to the throne in the apex of the room;
he seated himself and appeared to consider. Sard knew
that he had touched the beast to the quick by his remark
about the burial. He followed it up with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Dorney read the service very well, I understand.
You did not numb his brains, I gather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has few to numb,” Sagrado answered. “But I
am thinking of what you said about payment, and of you
paying me. You think yourself capable, do you, of standing
in a contest with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would do my best, the city scavenger being absent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sagrado laughed, yet seemed still to be considering: he
swayed a little to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet it is absurd,” he said. “It would be no fair
match.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are older,” Sard said, “that is true, but you are
fresh. I have already fought twice this night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had not heard that,” Sagrado answered. “I heard
that you had been beaten: did you refer to that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was not in my mind,” Sagrado said, “when I
wondered at the fitness of the match. The issue is not
between Master and servant, but between the civilised
world and its Destroyer. You are disgusting to me, but
not important enough. You are not master of your destiny.
You are a part of the scum of life, which is active for another
(though without religion) and worried for another, though
without purpose. And your talk is such as one would
expect: it is prejudice based on ignorance, just like your
press. Your sports, your muscle, your fair play, all these
catchwords which you repeat when people ask you for
intelligence, degrade men. Shall we say that they are the
barrel-organs played loudly that men may not know of the
degradations done to manhood?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may say what you like,” Sard said, “the sewer
of your mind is probably better fluent than stagnant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see what you are,” Sagrado answered, “the prop of
it all, the sergeant, the second mate, the curé, the school-master,
the petty officer.” He strode up to Sard and boxed
his ears. “Pah!” he said, “you have no foundations,
you paltry thing. You talk about manhood, probably,
and reckon yourself a man; not a gentleman, of course,
for that not even you would pretend, even at sea, but a
man, no doubt. You, a preacher and a slave; who cannot
know what manhood is. I will tell you what it is: it is
the attainment of power and the use of power. Old as I
am, I will show you. You shall stand in the wrestle with
me. Esclavos!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At his call the group of seven Indians entered. Sard
saw them in the light now; seven wild animals, with a
light in their eyes from the desire of blood: they had faces
without mark of mirth or pity. At a sign from Sagrado
they cast loose Sard’s chains. Sagrado cast off his scarlet
robe and stretched his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are free,” Sagrado said. “Come, then, to the
test. Why do you not come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard hesitated for a second, thinking that one of the
Indians would surely knife him when he moved. He felt
that he had reached his end, and that this was how he was
to die, shut up here with wild beasts in the presence of his
love. He glanced at Margarita, and stood with dropped
hands, letting the blood run into his numbed arms again.
He meant to hit Sagrado before he died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The preacher hesitates,” Sagrado said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard glanced again at Margarita; her look made it all
worth while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t hesitate,” Sard said. “But keep your slaves
from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are meat for the sacrifice,” Sagrado answered,
“they will not touch you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time, then,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rushed at Sagrado and landed with both hands upon
a guard which he could not break. Stepping back, he
trod into an Indian, while another Indian lurched into his
side. There were Indians all round him; a sort of net of
Indians. Sagrado came at him and gripped him; he
clinched and drove in short-arm blows at Sagrado’s ribs;
an Indian tripped him, and Sagrado got a better hold as
he staggered. Sagrado was as strong as an ox and quick
as a wild beast. Sard was a strong man, but this was a
bull-bison of a man. He wrenched an arm free and struck
with it; an Indian parried the blow; Sagrado changed his
hold and pinned the arm: it was like fighting with an
octopus. Indians, stooping down, snatched at Sard’s
ankles. Presently Sard tripped and fell: Sagrado brought
his shoulders to the mat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” he said, “you are down. Give in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t,” Sard said. He struck Sagrado’s mouth and
flung him aside. He rose to his feet, as Sagrado rose
swearing and savage. He had cut Sagrado’s lip on a tooth,
and Sagrado’s mouth bled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall pay for that,” Sagrado said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sard struck him again on the mouth and saw the blood
quicken in the cut; he struck again; the Indians caught
his arm, Sagrado pinned it and closed with him. They
swayed to and fro, while the Indians struck him in the
lower ribs, trying for the death-touch. Sard felt Sagrado’s
fingers squirming free for a death-touch, which he did not
know and could not guard. The death-touch came. A
deadly weakness turned all Sard’s strength to water. He
went down and felt his life die away, and then ebb partly
back. He knew that he must rise, and tried hard to rise,
but he was down, he could not rise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few seconds he tried again, but now Sagrado had
him by the throat. “Not so,” Sagrado said. “You are
beaten. Try that again and I will break something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not finished yet,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you are,” Sagrado answered. “But since you
doubt it, there goes your arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a swift jerk he snapped Sard’s arm against a
fulcrum, and then twisted the broken bone so that Sard
cried and swooned. Sagrado waited till he had recovered
and then bound him to his pillar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” he said; “you thought yourself a man.
You make a poor show in the hands of a man. Do you
admit that you are beaten?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are beaten, by one twenty years older than yourself,
and in the presence of your lady-love, who is now my
lady-love. Those friends of yours, who were coming, are
somewhat overdue. I’ve beaten you and chained you to
your pillar with my own hands. Do you admit that I am
your master? Answer, dog; reply, my second mate.
For I am your master. The lion has caught his meat;
the bull has won his heifer. And now the rites shall begin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said something in Indian to the slaves, who brought
forth properties from an inner room. They brought robes,
rings, a crown, a sword. Then the negro appeared bearing
an altar of an evil design, which he set to Sagrado’s hand.
The Indians brought forward the throne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The negro held the robe for Sagrado.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I put on the garments of a king,” Sagrado said. “It
is the colour of power. It was woven by a woman who
killed her son and lived in infamy till she was hanged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your sister, I presume,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The negro held the rings to Sagrado, who put them on
his fingers and on his thumbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These rings,” he said, “are beaten from your Christian
chalices, and reconsecrated to your Master’s master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The negro held the sword to Sagrado, who took it, kissed
it and held it to his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This sword,” he said, “is the steel of the guillotine of
revolution which slays, unjustly, the shrieking innocent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The negro laid hands upon the crown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See the crown,” Sagrado said. “The gold that men
betrayed for, the diamond that women whored for, the
ruby that men murdered for, the lead that took life, and
the poisonous metals which destroy life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The negro, advancing, crowned Sagrado.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sagrado sat still for a moment upon this throne. Once
again Sard had the impression that something evil flowed
into the man to make him bigger: he seemed to dilate and
glow with an increase of personality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take now the oil and the wine of evil,” Sagrado said,
“and anoint me to the worship of evil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The negro anointed and asperged Sagrado, with some
intoned words of ritual which were in no tongue known to
Sard. The Indians had heaped carib leaf upon the brazier,
which poured forth stupefying smoke. The negro began to
chant a hymn with a rhythm which seemed to go between
the marrow and the bone. Whatever it was, it stirred
the Indians. They were standing three and three on each
side of the throne: the seventh fed the brazier. They
sometimes marked a rhythm with a stamp and a catching
of the breath: their eyes became brighter and brighter,
and turned upwards till they were absorbed within themselves.
Their tongues licked to and fro as though they
were lapping blood. Sagrado rose to his feet and drew his
sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” he said, “I draw the sword of evil for the deed
that crowns evil.” He advanced to Sard and pressed the
point of the sword upon his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do obeisance to evil,” he said, “and you shall live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Apply to the marines,” Sard answered, “not to the
deck department.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do obeisance to evil,” Sagrado said, “and your lady-love
shall be spared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not be spared,” Margarita cried; “I defy you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dirty lunatic,” Sard said, “do your damnedest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have not said one thing yet,” Sagrado said; “that
you would rather die a thousand deaths, etc.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do
you say that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall, then, die a thousand deaths. And you shall
beg life from me before you die the third.” He turned to
the negro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anoint this beast for the sacrifice,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tremor of excitement passed through the Indians.
The negro cut away Sard’s shirt so as to bare the throat
and heart. Then he poured the stolen wine over Sard’s
head. Sard shook the drops from him and glanced at
Margarita, who was thinking of him, not of herself. She
gave him her love in a look. An Indian came to each side
of Sard: each held a pointed knife to his cheek, so that he
could no longer see Margarita, only know that she was there,
and gazing at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crown the beast for sacrifice,” Sagrado said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indian came forward with a wreath of white flowers
which had been drenched in patchouli; he crowned Sard
with it and the Indians laughed and clapped their hands.
The negro thrust it down upon Sard’s brow, so that the
thorns in it drew blood, which slowly trickled into his
eyes and dripped on to his chest. Sagrado laughed. He
paused for an instant as though gathering evil: again he
seemed to swell. He held the sword in both hands, with
his thumbs uppermost, pointing straight at Sard. For a
moment he stared at Sard along the line of the blade; then
his head went back and his eyes turned upward in
invocation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He cried aloud upon the evil of the ages and of the day
and of the hour to descend upon him. It seemed to Sard
that the house filled with a murmur as though the evil
obeyed his call. He heard, as it were, wings, and, as it
were, voices, and knew that death came with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel you,” Sagrado cried, “I know you, I obey you.
I offer you this beast in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The murmur of wings and voices grew louder. In their
greed for blood the devils beat upon the door: their teeth
snapped like shaking chains. The Indians laughed, clapped
their hands and moaned: “Ahi! ahi! ahi-a-hé!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then from the hall somewhere behind Sard came a
woman’s scream of “Danger! Look out!” which was
stifled in the throat as by a blow or a gag. Someone seemed
to be heaving on the sliding panels and banging on the door
behind the throne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sagrado laughed with a high, clear, inhuman cry:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all my strength and will and spirit,” he cried, “I
offer you the life of this beast in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a crash both behind and in front of Sard:
there was a deafening bang: someone fell over the brazier,
which upset. All the stinking and smouldering carib leaf
rolled from its metal pot. The room at the instant filled
with men: they were all in green and silver. Sagrado
whirled about to face them: one of them with a rifle beat
the sword out of his hand: it broke below the hilt and fell
in two pieces. After the crash, there came a silence so
great that the double tinkle and clatter of the broken sword
was memorable. The ball of carib leaf broke open, smoking
violently: wisps of gunpowder-smoke drifted past. Sard
could not imagine what had happened: all that he saw was
so tight and red: but one of the Indians was lying on the
floor, hardly moving. The men in green and silver were
covering the rest with rifles. Behind the riflemen Sard
saw the white but interested faces of Paggy and Crockums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was deep silence for nearly half a minute. Then
somebody flung open a door which brought a gush of pure
air into the foulness. An officer who had Sagrado covered
with a revolver trod out the carib leaf under his feet. Two
guards advanced, struck Sagrado suddenly on the
wrists, knocking them together, then instantly twisted the
twitch or cuero about them and wrenched it taut. Sard
thought, “I have often heard that they put the twitch on
criminals. They can break a man’s wrists with it, so they
say. Now there it is, actually done, before my eyes. They
have him at their mercy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sagrado neither spoke nor struggled. He was like one
drugged and unable to speak through the drug. He
thought no more of Sard, but plainly did not yet know what
had happened. The negro had turned whitish under his
colour: the Indians moved no muscle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dictator strode through the guards and spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” he said, “a nice, pretty Christian scene of play!
And Harker mio, my benefactor. One turn deserves
another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Guardias kept flooding into the room. They sorted
themselves into couples, who advanced, each couple, to an
Indian, put the cuero on him and dragged him aside. The
Dictator with his own hands beat and tore at Margarita’s
chains. A chief of guardias, who had keys about him,
unlocked the padlocks; the chains clanked to the floor,
Sard and Margarita were free. The two reefers were white
and subdued, but both were kind and helpful. They brought
chairs for the two victims, and then, after a little search,
brought water in some bronze bowls and mopped their
brows. “You’re among friends, Miss,” they said. “No
one shall hurt you.” “You’re all right, sir,” they said to
Sard; “you’ll soon feel better. It’s all right now, sir;
those devils are all cueroed up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Dictator had helped to restore the two victims,
he turned to the guards. “Take those Indios and this
negro out into the Plaza for the present,” he said. “Leave
this leader of theirs. I wish a little to examine him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the last of the eight had been removed, the Dictator
turned to Margarita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Kingsborough,” he said, “I’m glad to be able to
say that your brother is safe. He will do well enough; but
I have thought it better to have him to my palace for my
doctor to overhaul. Presently, when my carriages come,
you shall join him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now I will a little question this atavist, this throwback,
who has so nearly destroyed my Harker. Bring this
creature to the light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man who held the twitch brought Sagrado forward.
Sagrado seemed dazed still, but in his dream he was unwilling
to be seen; he shrank from the Dictator and bowed
his head into his robes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see him,” the Dictator said. “Hold up his
head to the light. So, tear away that crown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man flung the crown to the ground: Sagrado was
displayed: he turned whiter, but became more himself.
The Dictator looked hard at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have met before,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have had dealings,” Sagrado said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, it is Rafael Hirsch returned; one more who has not
yet paid me for Carlotta. Are you not Rafael Hirsch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were fifty Rafael Hirsches,” Sagrado answered,
“you would not be paid for Carlotta. You will carry that
wound to your death, and no son of yours will carry on your
work here. Killing her has kept you sterile at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good work is fruitful of itself,” the Dictator answered.
“My work is my son and my daughter. My people will
inherit from me. So, Rafael Hirsch, we who once talked
of magic together, see where our magics have led us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The game is not yet over, Manuel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The game is never over, Rafael Hirsch, never, never,
never, whether in its mercy or in its fire. Have you anything
to say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not with words,” Sagrado said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not with deeds,” the Dictator said. “And yet, one
thing you can say, one thing you know which you can tell
me. Upon what spot of these accursed stones was she of
whom we spoke bestially murdered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I have life, if I say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not judged to death yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sagrado seemed to consider this in all its bearings, while
the others watched him. A kind of hope kindled on his
face for a moment; he even smiled: then he studied the
Dictator’s face and smiled again, more bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you would like to know that, Manuel,” he said,
“ ‘pretty damned bad,’ as they say. You will not know it
from me. But I do know it. What is more, Manuel; I
heard what she said, before the knife-point touched her
throat. Shall I tell you what she said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dictator made a sign with one hand: Sagrado was
removed. A guardia’s hand upon his throat made his
telling of what she said unintelligible, furious as it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dictator crossed himself and remained in prayer until
the noise of feet and of raving were shut away by the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” he said. “So passes the pride of power, into
madness which brings a judgment. I knew that man as
a scholar of strange things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He paused and then
continued in English:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you would like to know what brings me here, so like
the Deus in the play. You must thank these two reefers
here: Mr. Paggy and Mr. Crockums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your brother, Miss Kingsborough, was left for dead in
this house. He was not dead, however. He managed to
crawl to the wall and there broke a window. Mr. Paggy
and Mr. Crockums happened to be in the Plaza when the
glass broke. They were in a state familiar to young men:
a romantic state, of pining for romance. They thought that
some woman was imprisoned here against her will. Hearing
Mr. Kingsborough’s tale, they ran for help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now at that very time I was coming to the Plaza, on
my way to Santa Alba, where I wished to meditate
before Mass; for often in meditation light comes. These
reefers ran into my party only a hundred yards from
here. I, hearing their story, sent at once for the guardias
of the ward, while I surrounded the house with my guard.
At the back of the house I found a man whose ways I
did not like, one Sumecta, whom I detained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought at that time that I was dealing with things
commonplace, but directly I had made an entrance into the
back of the house, I smelt the carib leaf. When I smelt the
carib leaf, I smelt devilry. For remember, Harker mio, I
am a son of this land, where the devils are strong, and come
much into human affairs. In my youth, for which God has
punished me, I sought their help, so I know who uses carib
leaf and when and why. So I come in, I and my guards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly, if the reefers had not been prompt and I not
where I was with my party, we should have been too late.
However, we were in time. Now, Harker mio, taste here
this brandy. You are very white.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My arm is broken, sir,” Sard said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Facundo,” the Dictator said to an equerry, “see that
the carriages, when they come, stay in the street at the back,
not in the Plaza. See also that a doctor be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the equerry had gone, the Dictator turned to
Margarita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady,” he said, “what shall be done to these devil-worshippers?
Doom or mercy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have been glad of mercy a few minutes ago,”
Margarita said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, Harker mio, would you kill them or not
kill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty minutes ago I would have killed them,” Sard
said. “Then I fought with that man and did not win. I
would not have others do what I could not do myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, the reefers?” the Dictator asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They ought to be hanged, sir,” Paggy said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, sir,” Crockums said, “I don’t know about
their being hanged. I don’t know what laws you may have,
nor what they deserve, according to your laws.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that instant, from without, there came a shattering
volley of rifles, which made all present leap. While they
stared at each other, plaster and glass pattered and tinkled
down somewhere outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” the Dictator said, “is what they deserve according
to my laws. Nor are my laws savage, seeing that I live
in the South, where things bite worse and poison is more
fell than in the North, where even the Devil is cold-blooded.
So, they are gone where justice is less fallible than here;
there they will receive, no doubt, the surplus which we, in
our human weakness have failed to give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But come, enough of them: they are dead. I hear my
carriages. We will leave this place of devilry, for breakfast
at the palace. You reefers, too; you have deserved it: I
will explain to your captain. Come, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An equerry entered and saluted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Excellency’s carriages are now in the street without,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” the Dictator answered. “Santiago, y cierra
España. Miss Kingsborough, I give you one arm; but
the other I give to Harker mio.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Excellency,” Margarita said, “Mr. Harker only
has one arm, and that is mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better still,” the Dictator said. “Now I may have
your persuasion to offer him a crutch; or shall we say a
rest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Sard and Margarita had been dazed by the doings of
the morning. Sard, who had been cut, battered and
bruised, was weary from fighting and in pain from his arm.
He was not able to speak. He felt like one who had had an
immense day’s work, which was now done and well done.
Margarita was at his side; that was a happiness; his dream
had come true; that was a marvel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriages moved out into the light of the dawn
through the white-blossomed thorn-tree avenue which led
to Cachopos. The sun was just clear of the sea: the birds
were going out and the flower-sellers coming in. Sard had
Margarita at his side and the Dictator and a doctor opposite.
The little white pennons of the lances of the escort
fluttered like butterflies. Off Cachopos, a lofty English
barque was coming in on the last of the breeze. She stole
along like a ghost, white to the trucks, with a roll of brighter
white at her lips which she seemed to stoop to drink. From
the church of Santa Alba there came the exquisite pure
sound of singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriages swung away from all this towards the
palace, which shone above them among the forest. Behind
it, far away, were the mountains, peak upon peak, some of
them forested, some snowy; one, with a brow of crag,
streaked with cataracts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dictator pointed towards the sea, now shut from
sight by many snowy branches. “That is shut from you
now, Harker mio,” he said; “but when one door shuts
another opens. Here is all this land waiting for you. To
me, this land has only given work; to you, I see, it has
already given all things; let me then add work to those.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When my arm is mended,” Sard said. “But your
Excellency will have to ask my wife.”</p>

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
